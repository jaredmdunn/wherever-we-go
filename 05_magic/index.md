# Magic in *Wherever We Go*

Magic in *Wherever We Go* is powerful, flexible, and dangerous. It lets characters reshape the fiction in big, strange ways—but it always comes with a cost and a chance that things go sideways.

Rather than fixed spell lists, magic is about what your character can imagine and justify in the fiction, framed by:
- The **kind of magic** they practice (their magical talent).
- The **rank of the spell** they are attempting.
- The **risk of a magical mishap** when they push beyond safe limits.

---

## Casting Spells

Magic works differently from other talents.

When you cast a spell, follow the fiction first: describe what your character is trying to do, how it looks or feels, and what kind of magic they are using. Then resolve it with the rules:

1. **Set the intent and effect.**  
   - What are you trying to accomplish? Harm, protection, knowledge, movement, transformation, influence, etc.  
   - The more sweeping, precise, or reality-bending the effect, the higher the spell’s **rank** will likely be.

2. **Choose an Attribute and Magic Talent.**  
   - The GM chooses the most appropriate **Attribute** for the spell (often **Presence**, **Precision**, or **Insight**, but any Attribute might apply).  
   - You roll with your **magic talent** instead of a skill—for example, **Symbols and Secrets**, **Pact and Prayer**, or **Story and Song**.

3. **Determine spell rank (1–3).**  
   - **Rank 1:** Subtle, limited, or short-lived magic. A quick ward, a single burst of energy, brief illusions, a small healing effect.  
   - **Rank 2:** Significant, scene-shaping magic. Area effects, strong barriers, meaningful transformations, potent healing or harm.  
   - **Rank 3:** High-impact, risky magic that can reshape a conflict or location: wide areas, lasting transformations, powerful curses or blessings.

4. **Build the dice pool.**  
   - Roll: **Attribute + Magic Talent** (no skill dice).  
   - Add **stress dice** or other bonuses as usual if you push, accept a devil’s bargain, or use relevant abilities.

5. **Spend Willpower (WP).**  
   - Every spell costs **1 WP** to cast.  
   - You may spend extra WP before rolling to reduce the chance of a **magical mishap** (see below).

6. **Roll and interpret the result.**  
   - Resolve the spell as an **action roll**: count **edges** to gauge how effective and controlled the magic is.  
   - Check the **magic talent die** for a mishap result. If the talent die shows a mishap number, something goes wrong, even if the spell “works.”

The GM and table should always lean on the fiction when deciding rank, consequences, and what mishaps look like. Magic is meant to feel powerful but volatile.

---

## Spell Rank and Magical Mishaps

Powerful magic is riskier, especially for less experienced casters.

The **rank** of the spell determines which numbers on your **magic talent die** trigger a mishap:

| Spell Rank | Mishap Numbers on Magic Talent Die |
|-----------:|-----------------------------------|
| Rank 1     | Only **1s**                       |
| Rank 2     | **1s and 2s**                     |
| Rank 3     | **1s, 2s, and 3s**                |
| Rank 4     | **1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s**            |
| Rank 5     | **1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, and 5s**        |

Only the **magic talent die** is checked for mishaps. 1s on other dice in the pool do **not** cause magical mishaps.

Because talent dice grow larger as you advance (D6 → D8 → D10 → D12), more experienced casters roll bigger dice with the same mishap window:
- A Rank 1 spell is riskier for a caster with **D6** magic than for someone with **D12**.  
- High-rank spells always carry real danger, but masters have a better chance of avoiding disaster.

---

## Willpower and Managing Risk

Every spell costs **1 WP** to cast.

Before you roll, you may spend **additional WP** to steady your magic and reduce the chance of a mishap:
- Each extra WP spent **reduces the highest mishap number by 1**, down to a minimum of **1**.
- Example: Casting a **Rank 3** spell normally has mishaps on **1–3**. If you spend **2 extra WP** (3 WP total), you reduce the window to just **1**.

Some magical talents and abilities give you other ways to manage risk—by rolling fewer dice, shifting consequences, or trading your own health or resources to stabilize the casting.

---

## Spell Power and Edges

Every spell has a **base power** equal to its **rank**:
- A **Rank 1** spell starts at power 1.
- A **Rank 2** spell starts at power 2.
- A **Rank 3** spell starts at power 3.
- A **Rank 3** spell starts at power 4.
- A **Rank 3** spell starts at power 5.

When you roll to cast:
- Each **edge** on the action roll increases the spell’s power by **+1**.
- The GM and table interpret “power” based on the spell’s nature: more damage, larger area, longer duration, stronger control, more detailed information, and so on.

Some talents and abilities directly increase base power or add extra effects when you hit certain power thresholds.

---

## Magical Mishaps

When your magic talent die shows a mishap number for the spell’s rank, a **magical mishap** occurs.

Mishaps are complications caused by unstable, overreaching, or misaligned magic. A mishap might:
- Twist the spell’s effect in an unintended direction.
- Harm the caster or their allies.
- Attract unwanted attention or awaken something supernatural.
- Leave a lingering curse, scar, or magical imprint on the world.

Whether the spell still “works” when a mishap happens depends on the fiction and the roll:
- On strong edge results, the spell may succeed but bring heavy side effects.  
- On weak results, the spell might fizzle, backfire, or create a smaller, stranger outcome instead.

You can create a dedicated **mishap table** for your campaign, or improvise results based on the situation and type of magic being used. Mishaps should be dramatic but not arbitrary—let them drive the story forward in surprising ways.

---

## Spells that Modify Other Spells

Some magic modifies or interacts with another spell—shielding it, twisting it, amplifying it, or unraveling it (for example, an “Obscure Magic” effect that hides the presence of a spell).

When you cast a spell that **modifies another spell**:
- It costs **+1 additional WP** (2 WP total before any extra risk-reducing WP).
- The **effective rank** for mishap purposes is the **sum of both spells’ ranks**.

Example:
You cast a **Rank 2** protective ward and attempt to **obscure** it with a **Rank 1** modifying spell. The total effective rank is **3**, so mishaps occur on **1–3** on your magic talent die.

---

## Learning and Using Magic

In *Wherever We Go*, magic is not locked behind rigid lists. In principle, **any spell can be learned**, though some may:
- Require rare training, lost tomes, or a powerful teacher.
- Demand oaths, bargains, or offerings.
- Only be accessible through a specific class of magic.

When a player proposes a new spell effect, the GM should:
- Check it against the setting’s tone, palette, and existing truths.
- Decide which **magical talent** it falls under.
- Set an appropriate **rank** and **cost** (and possibly special requirements).

Magic is a conversation between player, GM, and world: what are you willing to risk to reshape reality?

---

## Classes of Magic (Magical Talents)

The different “classes” of magic in *Wherever We Go* are represented as **distinct magical talents**. Each one describes how you access and shape magic, what it looks like in the fiction, and what special abilities you gain as you advance.

All of these talents use the same core spellcasting rules above. What differs is:
- The **fictional source** of power.
- The **abilities** you unlock as your magic talent grows.
- What kinds of **costs, bargains, and mishaps** are most common for your style of magic.

Below are updated descriptions of the main magical talents, based on the earlier “class” concepts.

---

### Symbols and Secrets

You are a scholar of the arcane, weaving power from the secrets of runes, forgotten languages, and the careful study of ancient tomes. Your magic is methodical—every spell is a precise act of intellect and ritual.

- **Typical Linked Skill:** **Learning** (for research, deciphering, and theory).
- **Spell Style:** Written sigils, complex diagrams, invocations in dead tongues, carefully prepared formulae.
- **Common Costs:** Time, rare inks, fragile tomes, the need for quiet and preparation.

As your Symbols and Secrets talent improves, you can safely work with more complex formulae and higher-rank spells.

**Core Abilities (Concepts)**

- **Arcane Reference**
  When you consult a written version of a spell—such as a scroll, spellbook page, or etched diagram—you steady your casting with study instead of instinct.
  - When you cast a spell directly from a written reference you can see, **roll one fewer die** from your pool (usually removing a base Attribute die).
  - This reduces the chance of a magical mishap by narrowing the number of dice that can come up as mishap results, reflecting how careful preparation tempers raw chaos.
  - In combat, once the reference is in hand, consulting it is a **free action**.

- **Inscribed Runes**  
  By preparing runes in advance—drawn, carved, painted, or inlaid—you can store power for later.
  - Preparing a rune takes several minutes and cannot be done in the heat of battle.
  - Each rune is keyed to a specific spell effect and can be **used only once**.
  - When you cast a spell by activating a prepared rune, increase the spell’s **base power by +1**.
  - The spell is considered to originate from the rune’s location; you can activate it as long as you can **see** the rune.
  - Other casters with Symbols and Secrets may be able to recognize and activate your runes, for good or ill.

---

### Pact and Prayer

You are a vessel for higher powers, drawing magic from bonds with gods, spirits, or otherworldly patrons. Your spells are acts of faith, negotiation, and devotion.

- **Typical Linked Skill:** **Connection** (for dealing with deities, spirits, congregations, and cults).
- **Spell Style:** Prayers, hymns, invocations, bargains, and oaths.
- **Common Costs:** Offerings, obligations, taboos, and expectations from your patron(s).

Your Pact and Prayer talent measures how closely you are attuned to your patron and how safely you can channel their power.

**Core Abilities (Concepts)**

- **Sacred Petition**  
  When your magic goes awry, you can beg for mercy.
  - If a mishap would occur on a casting roll, you may spend **1 extra WP** to call on your patron.
  - You may **reroll one die** that came up as a mishap number on your magic talent die.
  - The new result stands, even if it is worse; repeated petitions may strain your relationship with the patron in the fiction.

- **Devotional Offering**
  By making a meaningful offering—a sacrifice, service, or treasured token—you can call down greater power.
  - The offering must be significant to both you and the entity (GM’s discretion).
  - When you make the offering, roll **Connection** to see how well it is received.
  - The next spell you cast in your patron’s name gains a **base power bonus equal to the number of edges** on that Connection roll.
  - Making an offering in combat is a **major action** and leaves you vulnerable.

---

### Life and Loss

You channel and manipulate the flow of life energy, drawing on your own vitality or that of others. Your magic is rooted in cycles of sacrifice and renewal, and it often blurs the line between healing and harm.

- **Typical Linked Skill:** **Survival** (for understanding bodies, ecosystems, and life cycles).
- **Spell Style:** Blood rites, growth and decay, skeletal hands, withering curses, verdant surges of life.
- **Common Costs:** Wounds, exhaustion, the deaths of creatures, or the scarring of land.

Your Life and Loss talent governs how much life-force you can safely move through yourself and others.

**Core Abilities (Concepts)**

- **Sacrificial Rite**  
  You can harvest power from a dying or recently dead creature.
  - When you **sacrifice another living creature** before casting—stealing away its life force as part of the ritual—the spell’s **base power increases**.
  - If the creature’s maximum **Strength** is **D6 or D8**, increase base power by **+1**.
  - If the creature’s maximum Strength is **D10 or higher**, increase base power by **+2**.
  - You must have killed the creature **within the same day** and be **touching** it as you cast.
  - A creature may only be sacrificed once; its life force cannot be harvested repeatedly.

- **Vital Expenditure**
  You can burn your own body as fuel to stabilize your magic.
  - Before casting, you may take **1–3 damage** to your **Strength or Agility** (your choice) as a minor action.
  - For each point of damage you take, you may **roll one fewer die** in your casting pool.
  - Fewer dice means fewer chances for mishaps, representing how you anchor the spell by grounding it in your own life force.
  - This self-harm is real and must be healed normally.

---

### Story and Song

You cast spells through performance—storytelling, music, dance, or other forms of art. Your magic is woven into your creative expression, shaping emotion, perception, and reality for those who witness it.

- **Typical Linked Skill:** **Performance** (for art, music, oration, and presence).
- **Spell Style:** Songs, spoken word, choreographed movement, tales that come to life.
- **Common Costs:** Time to perform, the attention of an audience, your focus and composure.

Your Story and Song talent measures how deeply your art is entwined with magical effect.

**Core Abilities (Concepts)**

- **Artistic Focus**  
  You can stabilize your magic through disciplined performance.  
  - If you play an instrument, sing, recite poetry, or otherwise perform as part of your casting, you may roll **Performance** as a **minor action** before you cast.  
  - For each edge on that Performance roll, you may **roll one fewer die** in your casting roll, reducing mishap risk while you stay in the flow of the performance.  
  - The benefits of this Performance roll persist on future casts as long as you take **no other actions besides casting or performing**.
  - **Table Antics (Optional):** Instead of rolling Performance, the GM may allow you to improvise a short in-character verse, chant, or story at the table. If everyone enjoys it, treat it as if you had rolled a solid Performance result.

- **Captive Audience**
  A receptive crowd amplifies your power.
  - When you perform for an attentive audience of at least **ten people** (GM’s discretion), and your spell’s target is among them, your spell’s **base power increases by +1**.
  - If the audience’s emotions strongly match the spell’s intent (adoration, fear, rage, etc.), the GM may grant an additional fictional benefit or advantage.

---

### Will and Whim

You are a conduit of unrestrained magic, shaping reality through pure force of will and the intensity of your desires. Your power is wild and deeply personal; your emotions are both your greatest weapon and your greatest risk.

- **Typical Linked Skill:** **Command** (for raw force of personality and presence).
- **Spell Style:** Sudden surges of power, instinctive blasts, reality warping to match your mood.
- **Common Costs:** Surging stress, unpredictable backlash, emotional fallout in your relationships.

Your Will and Whim talent measures how much raw, personal power you can channel before it tears you apart.

**Core Abilities (Concepts)**

- **Passionate Surge**
  You can invoke one of your **Drives or Passions** to supercharge a spell.
  - When you cast a spell that clearly aligns with one of your Passions, you may add a number of **D6s equal to that Passion’s intensity** to your casting pool.
  - You must describe how your emotion fuels the magic in the fiction.
  - This dramatically increases both your **potential power** and your **risk**, as more dice means more chances for mishaps and overreach.

- **Force of Will**  
  You can clamp down on chaotic magic through sheer determination.  
  - Before casting, you may spend **2 additional WP** (beyond the spell’s base cost).  
  - For each 2 extra WP spent this way, you **roll one fewer die** in your casting pool and increase the spell’s **base power by +1**.  
  - You can spend up to **6 additional WP** this way for a total of **+3 base power** and rolling three fewer dice.  
  - This represents you forcing the spell into a precise shape rather than letting it run wild.

### Components and Concoctions (Working Concept)

There is also room in *Wherever We Go* for a style of magic rooted in **physical ingredients**—powders, potions, charms, relics, and alchemical mixtures. This magical talent is still under development, but in most campaigns it might:

- Use **prepared items** (potions, bombs, charms, salves) as the primary way to deliver spells.
- Rely on **time, tools, and rare components** gathered during play.
- Shift some of the risk of mishaps from the moment of casting to the **moment of brewing or preparation**.

If you introduce this talent at your table, work with your group to define:
- What it looks like in the fiction.
- What its core abilities are (more powerful brews, delayed triggers, chained effects, etc.).
- How its mishaps differ from other magics (mutations, contamination, unstable mixtures).

---

## Using Magical Talents in Play

All magical talents are built on the same chassis as other talents in *Wherever We Go*: as your talent grows, you increase the **magic talent die** and unlock new **abilities**. Those abilities tell you:
- How your character’s magic looks and feels.  
- What special tricks, protections, or boosts you gain when casting.  
- Which unique costs, bargains, and mishaps are most likely for your style of magic.

Use this chapter together with the general rules for **Talents**, **Stress and Willpower**, and **Action Rolls** to bring magic to life at your table.

IDEA: make magic like Mage the Awakening, Ars Magica - the rank of a spell determines how many points can be spent on that spell to modify it from base
