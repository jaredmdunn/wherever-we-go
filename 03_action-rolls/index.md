# Action Rolls

The **action roll** is the most common roll you will make in *Wherever We Go*. An action roll determines not only whether your character succeeds, but also how well they succeed and what consequences may follow.

To make an action roll:

1. **Describe your action.** Say what your character is doing and what your goal is.
2. **Choose a skill.** Work with the GM to decide which skill best matches your approach.
3. **Set position and effect.** The GM establishes the position (the risk of consequences) and the effect (the potential outcome) of your action.
4. **Assemble your dice.** Roll your attribute die for the skill you are using, plus the die for the skill itself if you have it trained.
5. **Add extra dice.** Include any advantage or disadvantage dice, stress dice, gear dice, or drive dice that apply.
6. **Resolve the roll.** Count your **edges**: a result of 6+ gives 1 edge, while a 10+ gives 2 edges.
7. **Push if you must.** If you are unsatisfied with your result, you may push the roll by adding a stress die and rerolling everything.

The number of edges you roll determines the outcome:

- **0 edges:** Failure.
- **1 edge:** Mixed success.
- **2 edges:** Success.
- **3+ edges:** Great success.

## Position and Effect

Every action roll is framed by **position** (how dangerous the attempt is) and **effect** (what the action can achieve). These concepts communicate to the players what is at stake before the dice are rolled.

### Position

Position describes the risk involved in attempting the action. It communicates what kind of consequences are likely if you fail or partially succeed.

1. **Safe:** There are no real consequences, even on failure. You only roll in a safe position to determine the *degree* of success. Standard effect is the baseline.
2. **Controlled:** Low risk. Consequences are usually light, often resulting in minor complications or Level 1 harm.
3. **Risky:** The most common position. Consequences may include Level 1 or 2 harm, setbacks, or other complications.
4. **Desperate:** High risk. Severe consequences are possible, including Level 2 or 3 harm.
5. **Dire:** Extreme risk. Death or equally dire consequences are on the table. This position should be rare, reserved for pivotal story moments.

### Effect

Effect describes how much your action can accomplish, assuming it succeeds.

1. **None:** No effect is possible—if this is the case, you should not be rolling.
2. **Less:** The effect is reduced compared to expectations.
3. **Standard:** The expected or typical outcome.
4. **Great:** The outcome exceeds expectations and achieves more than is normally possible.
5. **Fantastic:** An extraordinary outcome beyond belief. Like Dire position, this should be reserved for pivotal story moments.

## Benefits and Consequences

Failure does not mean the story stops. Instead, the GM should apply **benefits and consequences** to keep the action moving forward. Sometimes a success comes with a cost, or a failure reveals a new opportunity.

### Benefits
- Increased effect (e.g., Standard becomes Great).
- Improved position for your next action or an ally’s action.
- Clear 1 stress.
- Gain 1 willpower.
- A new opportunity is revealed.

### Consequences
- Reduced effect (e.g., Standard becomes Limited).
- Worse position for your next action or an ally’s action.
- A new complication, threat, or obstacle arises.
- The opportunity is lost—you must try another approach.
- You take stress.
- You take harm.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes circumstances give you an edge or put you at a disadvantage.

- When you have **advantage**, add one **D8 advantage die** to your roll. Any edges from this die add to your total.
- When you have **disadvantage**, add one **D8 disadvantage die**. Any edges from this die subtract from your total.
- Advantage and disadvantage do not stack—you will never roll more than one advantage or disadvantage die. If both apply, they cancel out.

---

## Helping

When another PC or NPC helps you, they give you advantage on your roll. Instead of a standard D8 advantage die, the helper provides a die equal to their relevant skill rating. If multiple characters help, take the highest die available among them.

---

## Gear Bonuses

Weapons, tools, and other equipment can provide extra dice.

- Gear has a rating, usually from +1 to +3. This is the number of **D6s** you add to your roll when using that gear.
- Gear can degrade over time. When its bonus reaches 0, it is broken and unusable.

---

## Pushing and Stress

Pushing represents a character straining beyond their normal limits.

If you fail or get fewer edges than you want, you may choose to push:

- Add **1 stress die** to your pool and reroll everything.
- 1s rolled on stress dice have the same effect as normal stress rolls.
- 1s rolled on attribute and skill dice cause Level 1 or 2 harm (depending on whether 1 or 2 dice come up as 1).
- 1s rolled on gear dice degrade the gear.

## Opposed Rolls

Sometimes what matters is not the degree of success but simply who did better. In an **opposed roll**, both parties roll and compare edges. Whoever has more edges wins; ties go to the defender. Extra edges may grant additional benefits.

---

## Group Rolls

If the whole group attempts an action, one PC rolls while others assist if possible. Use the skill of the character who makes the most sense for the situation, and let allies contribute by providing help.

For example, if the party is sneaking together, the character with the lowest Stealth might make the roll, while the others help if the GM allows.
