# Action Rolls

The **action roll** is the most common roll you will make in *Wherever We Go*. An action roll determines not only whether your character succeeds, but also how well they succeed and what consequences may follow.

To make an action roll:

1. **Describe your action.** Say what your character is doing and what your goal is.
2. **Choose a skill.** Work with the GM to decide which skill best matches your approach.
3. **Set the position.** The GM establishes the position (the risk of consequences) of your action. See [Position](#position).
4. **Assemble your base dice.** Your base dice consist of your attribute die and the related skill die.
5. **Apply bonuses and penalties.** Step dice up or down as described in [Bonuses and Penalties](#bonuses-and-penalties).
6. **Add talent die if relevant.** If your roll is using a talent, add the talent die.
7. **ROLL.**
8. **Based on the result, decide if you want to push yourself.** If you push, gain 1 stress and add a number of D6s equal to your level of stress. **ROLL AGAIN**.
9. **Resolve the roll.** Count your **edges**: a result of 6+ gives 1 edge, while a 10+ gives 2 edges.

The number of edges you roll determines the outcome:

- **0 edges:** Failure.
- **1 edge:** Mixed success.
- **2 edges:** Success.
- **3+ edges:** Great success.

## Position

Every action roll is framed by **position** (how dangerous the attempt is). These concepts communicate to the players what is at stake before the dice are rolled.

1. **Safe:** There are no real consequences, even on failure. You only roll in a safe position to determine the *degree* of success. Standard effect is the baseline.
2. **Controlled:** Low risk. Consequences are usually light, often resulting in minor complications or Level 1 harm.
3. **Risky:** The most common position. Consequences may include Level 1 or 2 harm, setbacks, or other complications. **Spend 1 WP to add stress dice.**
4. **Desperate:** High risk. Severe consequences are possible, including Level 2 or 3 harm. **Always add stress dice.**
5. **Dire:** Extreme risk. Death or equally dire consequences are on the table. This position should be rare, reserved for pivotal story moments. **Always add stress dice.**

## Benefits and Consequences

Failure does not mean the story stops. Instead, the GM should apply **benefits and consequences** to keep the action moving forward. Sometimes a success comes with a cost, or a failure reveals a new opportunity.

### Benefits
- Improved position for your next action or an ally’s action.
- Clear 1 stress.
- Gain 1 willpower.
- A new opportunity is revealed.
- The action was more effective than expected.

### Consequences
- Worse position for your next action or an ally’s action.
- A new complication, threat, or obstacle arises.
- The opportunity is lost-you must try another approach.
- You take stress.
- You take harm.
- The action was less effective than expected.

## Bonuses and Penalties

Bonuses and penalties modify your **base dice** (attribute + skill) before you roll by **stepping** die sizes up or down along the ladder **d4 → d6 → d8 → d10 → d12**.

- **Step order:** Apply **bonuses** first to the **lower** of your two base dice; apply **penalties** first to the **higher** die.
- **Bounds:** No die can be increased above **d12** or reduced below **d4**.
- **Stacking & cancellation:** Add all modifiers together (Bonuses **+1/+2/+3**, Penalties **-1/-2/-3**). A +2 and a -1 results in a net **+1**. Apply the net result using the step order above.
- **Common sources:**  
  - *Bonuses:* traits, fine/specialized gear, help from allies, clever prep or positioning.  
  - *Penalties:* relevant harm, high stress/distraction, poor tools or conditions, strong opposition.

### Examples (starting from d8 + d4):
- Net **+1** → **d8 + d6**  
- Net **+2** → **d8 + d8**  
- Net **-1** → **d6 + d4**  
- Net **-2** → **d4 + d4**

## Helping

When another PC or NPC helps you, they give you **+1** to the roll. Each PC must justify how they are helping. Successful rolls may be required to provide help at the GM's discretion. Bonuses cannot go beyond **+3**.

## Pushing and Stress

Pushing represents a character straining beyond their normal limits.

**Banes:** Whenever you roll, any **1s** on **stress dice** (whether you pushed or not) are called **banes**.  
Banes always have consequences and **must** be assigned after the roll.

If you fail or want more edges, you may **push**:

1. **Add 1 stress.**
2. **Reroll** any dice you choose **except stress dice that landed on a 1**.
   (You may reroll base dice, talent dice, and any stress dice that did **not** show 1.)
3. **Also roll stress dice** equal to your current stress (D6s).
   Note: pushing increases the number of stress dice, which increases the chance of banes, but also the chance of extra edges.
4. Resolve the roll as normal, then assign any banes.

### Assigning Banes
After the roll, assign banes to one of the following, as fits the fiction (GM has final say):

- **Gear (if used):** Each bane reduces the item’s reliability by 1.
- **Harm – Body or Mind:** Convert banes assigned to a harm track into harm levels:
  - **1 bane → Level 1 harm**
  - **2 banes → Level 2 harm**
  - **3+ banes → Level 3 harm**

You may split banes among gear and harm (e.g., 1 bane to gear, 1 to Body).

## Opposed Rolls

Sometimes what matters is not the degree of success but simply who did better. In an **opposed roll**, both parties roll and compare edges. Whoever has more edges wins; ties go to the defender. Extra edges may grant additional benefits.

## Group Rolls

If the whole group attempts an action, one PC rolls while others assist if possible. Use the skill of the character who makes the most sense for the situation, and let allies contribute by providing help.

For example, if the party is sneaking together, the character with the lowest Stealth might make the roll, while the others help if the GM allows.
