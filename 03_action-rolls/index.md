# Action Rolls

The **action roll** is the most common roll you will make in *Wherever We Go*. An action roll determines not only whether your character succeeds, but also how well they succeed and what consequences may follow.

To make an action roll:

1. **Describe your action.** Say what your character is doing and what your goal is.
2. **Choose a skill.** Work with the GM to decide which skill best matches your approach.
3. **Talk about risks and consequences.** The GM makes clear what success looks like and what kinds of consequences might follow failure or a mixed result.
4. **Assemble your base dice.** Your base dice consist of your attribute die and the related skill die.
5. **Apply bonuses and penalties.** Step dice up or down as described in [Bonuses and Penalties](#bonuses-and-penalties).
6. **Add talent die if relevant.** If your roll is using a talent, add the talent die.
7. **Decide if you want to push yourself.** Before you roll, you may spend **1 WP** to add a number of stress dice (D6s) equal to your current stress.
8. **ROLL.**
9. **If you’re unhappy with the result, you may gamble.** Gambling lets you add 1 stress die and reroll, as described under [Pushing, Gambling, and Stress](#pushing-gambling-and-stress).
10. **Resolve the roll.** Count your **edges**: a result of 6+ gives 1 edge, while a 10+ gives 2 edges.

The number of edges you roll determines the outcome:

- **0 edges:** Failure.
- **1 edge:** Mixed success.
- **2 edges:** Success.
- **3+ edges:** Great success.

## Benefits and Consequences

Failure does not mean the story stops. Instead, the GM should apply **benefits and consequences** to keep the action moving forward. Sometimes a success comes with a cost, or a failure reveals a new opportunity.

### Benefits
- Improved situation for your next action or an ally’s action.
- Clear 1 stress.
- Gain 1 willpower.
- A new opportunity is revealed.
- The action was more effective than expected.

### Consequences
- Worse situation for your next action or an ally’s action.
- A new complication, threat, or obstacle arises.
- The opportunity is lost-you must try another approach.
- You take stress.
- You take harm.
- The action was less effective than expected.

## Bonuses and Penalties

Bonuses and penalties modify your **base dice** (attribute + skill) before you roll by **stepping** die sizes up or down along the ladder **d4 → d6 → d8 → d10 → d12**.

- **Step order:** Apply **bonuses** first to the **lower** of your two base dice; apply **penalties** first to the **higher** die.
- **Bounds:** No die can be increased above **d12** or reduced below **d4**.
- **Stacking & cancellation:** Add all modifiers together (Bonuses **+1/+2/+3**, Penalties **-1/-2/-3**). A +2 and a -1 results in a net **+1**. Apply the net result using the step order above.
- **Common sources:**  
  - *Bonuses:* traits, fine/specialized gear, help from allies, clever prep or positioning.  
  - *Penalties:* relevant harm, high stress/distraction, poor tools or conditions, strong opposition.

### Examples (starting from d8 + 0):
- Net **+1** → **d8 + d6**  
- Net **+2** → **d8 + d8**  
- Net **-1** → **d6 + 0**  
- Net **-2** → **0 + 0**

## Helping

When another PC or NPC helps you, they give you **+1** to the roll. Each PC must justify how they are helping. Successful rolls may be required to provide help at the GM's discretion. Bonuses cannot go beyond **+3**.

## Pushing, Gambling, and Stress

Pushing and gambling represent a character straining beyond their normal limits.

Your **stress** score is the number of stress dice (D6s) you roll when you choose to risk more on an action. You only roll stress dice when you **push** or **gamble** on an action roll.

**Banes:** Whenever you roll stress dice, any **1s** on those dice are called **banes**.
Banes always have consequences and **must** be assigned after the roll.

### Pushing (before you roll)

Before you roll an action, you may **push**:

1. **Spend 1 WP.**
2. **Add stress dice** equal to your current stress (roll that many D6s along with your normal dice).

Pushing does not change your stress score—it just lets you leverage the stress you already have for extra dice.

### Gambling (after you roll)

If you fail or are unhappy with the result, you may **gamble**:

1. **Increase your stress by 1** (and gain 1 additional stress die).
2. **Reroll** all your action dice and stress dice **except** any stress dice that are showing a **1** (banes stay locked).
3. Resolve the new roll as normal, then assign any banes.

Most of the time you can only gamble once on a given action roll; the GM has final say.

### Edges and Willpower from Stress Dice

Stress dice can help and hurt at the same time:

- Every stress die that shows an **edge** (a result of **6**) counts as **1 edge** toward your roll, just like any other die.
- For each such edge on stress dice, you also **gain 1 WP** (up to your maximum).

### Assigning Banes

After the roll, total your banes and assign damage to whatever makes sense in the fiction (the acting character, an ally, or a relevant piece of gear—the GM has final say).

Use the harm rules to translate banes into damage:

- **1 bane → 2 damage** (Minor harm).
- **2 banes → 4 damage** (Severe harm).
- **3+ banes → 6 damage** (Major harm).

Damage can be applied to:

- **Health** (physical harm).
- **Resolve** (mental or emotional harm).
- **Equipment** used in the action (reduced reliability, as appropriate).

You may split this damage between multiple targets if it fits the fiction.

## Opposed Rolls

Sometimes what matters is not the degree of success but simply who did better. In an **opposed roll**, both parties roll and compare edges. Whoever has more edges wins; ties go to the defender. Extra edges may grant additional benefits.

---

## Group Rolls

If the whole group attempts an action, one PC rolls while others assist if possible. Use the skill of the character who makes the most sense for the situation, and let allies contribute by providing help.

For example, if the party is sneaking together, the character with the lowest Stealth might make the roll, while the others help if the GM allows.
