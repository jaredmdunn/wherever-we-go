# Missions  

A **mission** is when the characters set out to accomplish a clear goal-steal something valuable, assassinate a target, rescue a captive, sabotage a fortress, negotiate a treaty, or uncover a mystery.  

Missions are about jumping straight into the action. Instead of playing out long planning scenes, *Wherever We Go* assumes that your characters are competent and have already made a plan. Play begins **in media res**-at the point of action-so the table can discover how the plan works (or doesn’t) as the story unfolds.

## Planning the Mission  

Before the mission begins, work with the GM to quickly define:  

1. **Type of Mission** - What kind of approach you’re taking: assault, stealth, deception, social, research, sabotage, etc.  
2. **Goal** - The objective: what success looks like (steal, kill, save, find, escape).  
3. **Starting Situation** - Who is present, where the first scene takes place, and what is happening when we cut into the action.  
4. **Clothing & Armor** - What your character is wearing into the mission, chosen from their inventory.  
5. **Item Loadout** - How much gear you’re bringing from your inventory (see below). Specific items can be declared later in play.  

This step shouldn’t take long-just enough to get everyone on the same page before we jump straight into the engagement roll and the opening scene.  

### Type of Mission  

Choose the overall approach for your mission. This frames the tone, position, and kind of challenges you’ll face. Examples include:  

- **Assault:** Kick in the door and take something by force.  
- **Stealth:** Sneak in, avoid notice, and get out unseen.  
- **Deception:** Trick, disguise, or mislead your opposition.  
- **Social:** Charm, negotiate, or persuade your way through obstacles.  
- **Research:** Gather knowledge, hunt clues, or investigate a mystery.  
- **Sabotage:** Break, disrupt, or disable something critical to the opposition.  

Your chosen type doesn’t lock you into one tactic, but it does set the *approach* that the GM uses to frame initial obstacles.  

### Goal  

Clarify what success looks like. This is the *objective* of the mission.  

- An **assault** might have a goal to *kill the gang boss* or *drive the enemy out of town*.  
- A **stealth** mission could aim to *free prisoners* or *steal an artifact without being seen*.  
- A **deception** might attempt to *smuggle contraband* past a checkpoint or *trick a noble into revealing secrets*.  
- A **research** mission might seek to *discover the source of the curse* or *locate a lost ruin*.  

Having a clear goal keeps the mission focused. If the goal changes mid-mission, that’s okay-it’s part of the evolving story.  

### Starting Situation  

Decide where we pick up the action. This is where you set the tone and context for the mission’s opening scene. The GM can prompt with questions like:  

- **When do you strike?** What time of day is it? Are you moving under cover of night, taking advantage of the morning crowd, or waiting until a festival when security is distracted?
- **Where do you begin?** Are you approaching the mayor’s mansion directly, ambushing him in public, or intercepting him on the road?
- **How are you approaching?** Are you sneaking, walking in boldly, arriving disguised, or charging head-on?
- **Who is coming with you?** Which allies or contacts are involved, and who’s staying behind?  

These questions should focus on how the characters enter the situation, not on detailed preparations. The answers will shape the first scene, help the GM establish some initial obstacles, and create a clear starting point for the engagement roll.

### Clothing & Armor  

Pick the clothing or armor your character is wearing from their inventory. If you want to bring more than one outfit-such as a change of clothes, a disguise, or backup armor-you’ll need to include it in your **item loadout** (below).  

Your choice of clothing and armor can influence your position: fancy attire might improve your effect at a noble’s ball, while traveling gear might put you in a worse position when trying to pass as a courtier.  

### Item Loadout  

Your **loadout** determines how many items you’re bringing on the mission from your inventory and how encumbered or conspicuous you are.  

| Loadout | Capacity | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Light** | 2 normal item slots (1 heavy, 4 light, or a mix) | Inconspicuous. Everything fits on your person-perfect for blending in or traveling light. |
| **Normal** | 4 normal item slots (2 heavy, 8 light, or a mix) | You carry a small bag or pack. Not suspicious on its own, but too big to conceal. If your bag is stolen or lost, you must remove 2 normal items worth of gear. |
| **Heavy** | 6 normal item slots (3 heavy, 12 light, or a mix) | Bulky and obvious. Clearly for adventuring, raiding, or traveling. You suffer **disadvantage** on Stealth rolls and other rolls where appearing discreet matters, and on Mobility rolls where a heavy load would slow you down. |

Loadouts are chosen before the mission begins, but you don’t need to list every item immediately. You may declare specific items later during the mission, as long as you still have open slots. This allows for cinematic moments where a character reveals the perfect tool at the right time.

## The Engagement Roll  

Once the plan is framed, the GM calls for an **engagement roll** to see how things begin:  

- Roll:  
  - The **highest Wits die** in the group (good intel, clear thinking).  
  - The **lowest Intuition die** in the group (how well you trust and coordinate with each other).  
  - **+1d6 for luck** - fortune always plays a part.  
- Add **+1d6 for each major advantage** (good intel, allies, resources, preparation).  
- Subtract **-1d6 for each major disadvantage** (enemy forewarned, poor conditions, time pressure).  

Count edges as usual:  

- **0 edges:** Things start badly. Position is **Desperate**.  
- **1 edge:** Mixed situation. Position is **Risky**.  
- **2 edges:** Solid start. Position is **Controlled**.  
- **3+ edges:** Great start. Position is **Controlled** and the first obstacle is already dealt with.  

This roll doesn’t decide success or failure-just where the PCs find themselves when the action starts.

## Flashbacks  

Flashbacks allow you to reveal preparations your characters made off-screen: bribing a guard, hiding gear, scouting the location, etc.  

- **Cost:** The GM sets the cost based on scope:  
  - Trivial or obvious prep? Free.  
  - Risky or resource-intensive prep? Pay with stress, willpower, coin, or other cost.  
- If the flashback requires a roll, resolve it normally. Poor results may increase the cost or introduce complications.  

Flashbacks let the table discover the plan as the mission unfolds, rather than front-loading every detail.

## Missions and Combat  

Missions frequently flow into **combat** when things get dangerous-and back out again when the danger passes. The mission continues until the objective is achieved, the characters retreat, or the situation changes so dramatically that a new goal must be set.

---

## Ending the Mission  

Missions end when the objective is reached (or abandoned). Often, the conclusion leads into a **montage**, where the characters recover, reflect, or handle the fallout of their actions.  

This is a great moment to take stock: What changed in the world? What opportunities opened-or closed? What new problems might arise because of what just happened?
