# Game Modes

*Wherever We Go* is a game about discovery, decisions, and consequences-and itâ€™s played as a conversation. That conversation naturally shifts between different **modes of play**, depending on what the characters are doing and how the story is unfolding.

Each mode offers a slightly different structure and focus, giving the table tools to zoom in on dramatic moments or fast-forward through stretches of time. Some modes keep things loose and conversational, while others add mechanics to create tension, spotlight risk, and ensure everyone gets a chance to act.

There are five primary modes of play:

- **Worldbuilding:** Collaborative creation of the world, its factions, and its tone.
- **Free Play:** The default mode where characters talk, explore, and act freely.
- **Mission:** Focused, action-driven play that jumps right into the heart of a plan.
- **Montage:** A structured way to cover longer stretches of time, downtime, or journeys.
- **Combat:** High-stakes situations where timing, danger, and spotlight matter.

A single session might use all of these, switch back and forth between two or three, or stay in one mode the entire time. The important thing is that each mode helps keep the story moving and supports the kind of play the group wants at that moment.

The sections that follow go into detail on each mode-how they work, when to use them, and what tools they offer players and the GM.
