# Worldbuilding  

Worldbuilding is the collaborative process of creating the setting, its cultures, factions, and mysteries together at the table. In *Wherever We Go*, worldbuilding is its own game mode-an intentional pause from playing as your characters to zoom out and shape the larger world they inhabit.  

This mode is most common in **Session 0**, where the group creates the world and characters together, but it can happen anytime: when you arrive in a new region, introduce a powerful faction, or decide you want to add new lore to the setting. Worldbuilding isn’t just prep-it is play.

## Playing Worldbuilding  

Worldbuilding in *Wherever We Go* is a **structured conversation** designed to make sure every player gets a chance to contribute, ideas are consistent with one another, and the resulting setting feels like it belongs to everyone at the table.  

### Setting the Scope  

The GM begins by framing what part of the world is being worked on:  
- Are you creating the **entire world** during Session 0?  
- Are you zooming in to define a **single region or city**?  
- Are you establishing a **new faction, religion, or culture** the characters just encountered?  
- Are you co-creating a **major event** or historical turning point that shapes the current moment?  

A clear scope helps focus everyone’s creativity and ensures you don’t get lost in details that aren’t relevant to the story at hand.  

### Setting the Palette  

Before adding anything to the world, the group first defines the **palette** for this session - what belongs and what does not. This ensures everyone at the table is aligned on tone, content, and boundaries.  

Take turns, starting with the GM, to declare:  
- **Add:** Something you’d like to see in the setting. Adds are elements that might appear during this session or later.  
- **Ban:** Something you do not want in the setting. Bans are absolute - they cannot appear in this session’s worldbuilding or be introduced later without the group’s agreement.  

> **Note:** If you’ve created a palette in a previous session, you can reuse it here as your baseline. However, it’s still a good idea to add a few session-specific Adds and Bans to reflect the **scope** of what you’re building this time - such as when focusing on a single city, faction, or region.  

You may go around the table once or twice, depending on how thorough you want to be. The GM should record all Adds and Bans somewhere visible (whiteboard, shared doc, or index cards) so everyone can reference them throughout play.  

> **Having the Focus:**
> 
> The player who currently has the focus is the one whose turn it is to speak and contribute. When you have the focus, you have full creative control over your contribution, as long as it respects the palette and previously established truths. Others may ask clarifying questions, but they should not veto or override your contribution unless it contradicts a Ban or a safety concern.

### Adding Truths and Details  

Once the palette is set, pass the focus again to begin filling the world with content. Each player, in turn, contributes **one element at a time**, which could be:  

- A **truth** - a short, declarative statement about the world (“The capital city is built on stilts above a swamp.”)  
- A **detail** - a concrete addition such as a location, faction, NPC, rumor, or connection between two existing elements.  

The GM should go first to set the tone and give an example. After that, pass the focus clockwise (or in whatever order makes sense) until everyone has contributed.  

Players are encouraged to build on what’s already been established - creating connections, relationships, or conflicts - but they should not contradict previous contributions unless they’re doing so intentionally and with group agreement.  

If a contribution would directly impact another player’s character (their background, family, or history), pause to get that player’s input. They may accept, modify, or reject the contribution - but this is a negotiation, not a hard stop. Collaborate until the table finds a version everyone is happy with.  

The GM’s job during this phase is to keep the pace moving, ask clarifying questions, and help connect contributions so the world feels coherent while still leaving room for surprises.

### Negotiation & Consent  

Worldbuilding works best when everyone feels ownership and safety. Follow these guidelines to keep the process collaborative and respectful:  

- **Respect Character Agency:** If a contribution directly affects a PC (their family, culture, backstory, etc.), check in with that player. They have the final say - they can accept, modify, or suggest an alternative. Treat this as a conversation, not a veto: collaborate until it feels right for everyone.  

- **Use the Palette as a Guardrail:** Adds and Bans are established before worldbuilding begins (see **Setting the Palette**). These should guide contributions throughout the session. If you’re unsure whether something fits, ask the table before adding it.  

- **Favor “Yes, And”:** Beyond the palette and character vetoes, avoid over-negotiation. If an idea doesn’t contradict existing truths, Bans, or safety tools, let it stand. Unexpected contributions often create the most interesting, memorable worlds.  

The GM acts as facilitator here - helping mediate disagreements, reminding the table of Bans and existing truths, and making sure everyone gets space to contribute.

### Recording the World  

Choose one player (often the GM) to keep a record of what’s been added to the world. This could include:
- Updating a shared document with truths, factions, and lore.
- Drawing on a collaborative map as locations and regions are named.
- Noting questions or open threads for later play.

This record becomes the living history of the campaign and a touchstone for consistency as the world grows.

## Session 0  

While worldbuilding can happen anytime, **Session 0** is where the group lays the foundation for the campaign. It uses the same principles outlined above - setting the scope, establishing a palette, and passing the focus - but on the largest possible scale.  

Session 0 is not just prep. It is a full session of play focused on building excitement, trust, and shared investment. Here’s a recommended approach:  

### 1. Safety and Tone  

Begin with a conversation about the kind of game everyone wants to play. Establish safety tools, boundaries, and tone up front so everyone can fully engage with the creative process.  

> **GM Tip:**  
> This is also the first time you “set the scope.” Pitch the broad strokes of the campaign: its genre, themes, and general tone (e.g., hopeful exploration, grim survival, political intrigue). Make sure everyone is excited about the concept before you move forward.  

### 2. Set the Palette  

Go around the table once or twice, giving each player the focus to propose **Adds** (elements they want to see) and **Bans** (elements that must be excluded). These set the creative boundaries for the session and guide the rest of worldbuilding.

### 3. Build Broad Strokes  

Once the palette is set, pass the focus again to define **truths** and **big-picture elements** about the world:  
- What is the state of the world (peaceful, chaotic, recovering from war)?  
- What are some of the major powers, factions, or forces shaping it?  
- What major mysteries, threats, or opportunities define this era?  

This is where players establish the “big canvas” together - the feel of the setting, its history, and its tensions.  

### 4. Narrow to a Region  

Next, zoom in to define the region where play will begin. Each player gets the focus at least twice to add something:  
- Outline regions, kingdoms, or districts on a shared map.  
- Place landmarks, ruins, or points of interest.  
- Add rumors, conflicts, or trade routes that tie these places together.  

This step creates the immediate sandbox where play will take place.  

### 5. Detail a Starting Location  

Once the region feels alive, pick a **starting location** as a group - a town, ship, outpost, or stronghold. Use a new sheet or map and take turns adding details:  
- Important NPCs and their agendas.  
- Key places (inns, guildhalls, ruins nearby).  
- Threats, hooks, and rumors that make the location feel dynamic.  

By the end of this step, you’ll have a vibrant starting point full of possibilities.  

### 6. Party and Character Creation  

Only after the world is established do you shift into creating characters. Use what you’ve just built as inspiration for character origins, bonds, and goals.  
- Collaboratively decide what kind of group you are (e.g., caravan guards, scholars, vigilantes).  
- Establish bonds between PCs - who knows whom, who trusts whom, and why you’re together.  
- Build characters mechanically, grounding them in the shared world you’ve just created.

See more on this in **Party and Character Creation**.

### 7. Wrap-Up

By the end of Session 0, you should have:
- A shared concept and tone for the campaign.
- A palette of Adds and Bans to guide future sessions.
- A living map with regions, locations, and connections.
- A starting location rich with NPCs, hooks, and opportunities.
- A party of PCs tied together and grounded in the world.

This approach ensures everyone has had multiple turns with the focus, contributed to each level of detail, and is invested in the world before the first scene of play even begins.

## Using Worldbuilding Mid-Campaign  

You don’t need to stop after Session 0. Worldbuilding can also be used to:  
- **Define a New Region** the party has just reached.  
- **Add a New Faction** that becomes important to the story.  
- **Answer Big Questions** about the setting that have emerged through play.  
- **Explore Lore Together** between arcs or after major events.  

Treat these moments as mini-Session 0s: set a scope, pass the focus, and record what’s added. This keeps the world dynamic and responsive to the story the players are telling.
