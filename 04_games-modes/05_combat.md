# Combat

Combat in *Wherever We Go* is fast, dangerous, and cinematic. Every exchange represents a few seconds of tense action, where characters act boldly, take risks, and deal with the consequences of violence. The rules of combat provide just enough structure to highlight danger, clarify positioning, and give everyone a chance to act.

---

## Rounds & Initiative  

Combat is divided into **rounds**, each representing about 5–10 seconds of frantic action. Initiative is handled by **sides**, not individuals: the PCs and their allies act as one group, and the GM’s NPCs act as the opposing group.  

At the start of combat, determine who acts first:  
- One player rolls **1d20** for the group.  
- On **11 or higher**, the PCs act first.  
- On **10 or lower**, the opposition acts first.  

The group with initiative keeps it until either:  
- A player fails an action (an attack misses, persuasion doesn't land, a run turns into a stumble, etc.)
- An NPC succeeds at a reaction (a block or dodge succeeds, a spell is countered, etc.)
- The players voluntarily give up initiative (to regroup or set up a trap).

When initiative shifts, the other side takes over until control shifts again. Within each group’s turn, players (or NPCs) can act in any order they choose.

> **Why This Structure?**
> 
> This system emphasizes momentum and consequence. Initiative flows back and forth based on success and failure, keeping everyone engaged.

### Surprise

If the PCs catch the opposition completely off-guard, they may get a **Surprise Round** before initiative is rolled.  

- Each PC participating in the ambush gets to take **one major or minor action**.
- The opposition cannot react during the Surprise Round.
- After the actions are resolved, roll for initiative as normal.

If any PC fails during the surprise actions, the enemies are alerted and can react immediately, canceling the remaining surprise actions.

**Determining Surprise:**  
- For ambushes, make an opposed **Stealth vs. Observation** roll.  
- For sudden attacks in social scenes, make an opposed **Deception vs. Insight** roll.  
- Apply **advantage or disadvantage** based on circumstances: distance, noise, cover, or alertness of the enemy.

### Sneak Attacks  

A **sneak attack** is a special case where a single PC attacks from hiding or without being detected:  

1. Make a **Stealth roll** (opposed by Observation).  
   - **Near range:** roll normally.  
   - **Arm’s Length:** roll with **disadvantage** (closing to strike is harder).  
2. On success, you surprise the target and make your attack with **advantage**.  
3. If you are using a subtle weapon (e.g. dagger), you may roll the attack using **Stealth** instead of **Melee**.

## Zones & Ranges  

Combat takes place in **zones**, which represent distinct areas on the battlefield: a room, a clearing, or a stretch of ground. Zones help abstract positioning while keeping the fiction clear.  

Within zones, combatants interact at different **ranges**:  

| Range         | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Arm’s Length** | Close enough to touch, grapple, or strike with a melee weapon. |
| **A Step Away** | Just outside of Arm’s Length - you can close the distance with a single step. Ideal for reach weapons. |
| **Near** | In the same zone but not adjacent - you can reach Arm’s Length with a quick move. |
| **Short** | In an adjacent zone - across a small room, down a hallway, or just beyond a narrow barrier. |
| **Long** | Several zones away (up to four). Crossing the distance usually takes multiple moves or special effort. |
| **Distant** | Far away - across a canyon, on a high balcony, or at the edge of a battlefield. Only the longest-range weapons or magic can reach. |
| **Extreme** | At the limit of sight. Attacks at this range are rarely possible without special equipment or extraordinary effort. |

The GM can adjust the number and size of zones to match the fiction. A close-quarters tavern brawl might be a single zone, while a running fight through city streets might span several.

## Combat Actions

IDEA: Major and Minor actions are not specified explicitly. They are instead open to the GM's discretion with just a few examples.

Combat is a conversation, just like free play and missions - but timing and action economy matter more here. Because every second counts, actions are broken into **major** and **minor** actions to help balance pacing and spotlight.

Each participant can take **one major action and one minor action**, or **two minor actions**, per round. Some abilities, talents, or effects may grant extra actions.

> **Attacking, Defending, and Opposed Rolls**
> 
> - **Attacking Actions:** Any action that directly targets another creature - striking them, grappling them, persuading them, taunting them, etc.
> - **Defending Reactions:** When an attacking action targets you, you may defend if you still have an action left. Most defensive reactions (like dodge or block) are minor actions.
> - **Opposed Rolls:** When an action calls for an opposed roll, it only counts as an action for the **acting creature** (the one initiating the roll). This is different from defending reactions, which do cost the defender one of their available actions.
> - **Attack Rolls & Edges:** In combat, a successful attack requires rolling at least **one more edge** than the defender. Unlike other rolls, a single edge margin counts as a full success. If the defender cannot or chooses not to defend, only one edge is needed to succeed.

### Major Actions

Major actions are the centerpiece of your turn - bold, decisive moves that change the state of the fight: attacking, grappling, sprinting, or performing high-impact tasks.

| Action          | Roll          | Quick Description |
|-----------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Melee Attack** | Melee | Strike with a melee weapon. |
| **Unarmed Attack** | Might | Punch, kick, or bite. |
| **Ranged Attack** | Marksmanship | Fire or throw a ranged weapon. |
| **First Aid** | Medicine / Connection | Stabilize a Broken ally. |
| **Grapple** | Might | Grab and restrain an opponent, knocking them prone. |
| **Break Free** | Might (Opposed by Might) | Escape a grapple and reposition. |
| **Crawl** | Mobility (if needed) | Move while prone, staying low and slow. |
| **Flee** | Mobility | Escape combat entirely if you have a clear exit. |
| **Reload** | - | Reload a ranged weapon (crossbow, musket, etc.). |
| **Persuade** | Manipulation | Convince an enemy to act differently mid-fight. |
| **Taunt** | Performance (Opposed by Insight) | Anger or distract an opponent. |
| **Retrieve Item** | - | Draw something from your pack or gear. |
| **Cast Spell** | See Tradition | Use a magical ability or invocation. |

#### Melee Attack  
Make a close-range attack with a melee weapon. Roll **Melee**.  
- On a success, you deal your weapon’s base damage.  
- Each additional edge deals +1 damage.  
- The attack can be dodged or blocked.  

> You swing your sword, axe, or club in a decisive strike, the clash of steel ringing through the fray.  

#### Unarmed Attack  
Strike with fists, feet, claws, or teeth. Roll **Might**.  
- On a success, deal 1 damage.  
- Each additional edge deals +1 damage.  
- Can be dodged or blocked.  
- Traits like *Natural Weapon* may increase damage or add special effects.  

> You throw a punch or grapple violently, relying on raw strength to bring your foe down.  

#### Ranged Attack  
Make an attack with a bow, sling, firearm, or thrown weapon. Roll **Marksmanship**.
- On a success, you deal the weapon’s base damage.
- Each additional edge deals +1 damage.
- Can be dodged (if the target is aware) or blocked with a shield.

> You loose an arrow or fire a shot, the sound of twanging string or gunfire cutting through the chaos.

> **Ranged Combat Notes:**
> 
> - **Readying & Loading:** Bows, slings, and other quick weapons must be readied as a minor action before firing. Crossbows, muskets, and other slow weapons require a major action to load. If you take an unrelated action, you must ready the weapon again before shooting.
> - **Ammunition:** After each shot, roll your ammo’s **resource die** (D6–D12). On a 1–2, the die steps down one size. When it’s gone, you’re out of ammo.
> - **Action Economy:** Drawing, readying/loading, aiming, and shooting each take separate actions - it may take multiple rounds to go from unarmed to a precise shot.
> - **Situational Factors:** The GM may grant advantage or impose disadvantage based on visibility, distance, cover, target size, or nearby allies. Shooting into melee or through crowds carries risk - on a miss, you might hit the wrong target.

#### First Aid  
Attempt to stabilize a Broken ally or prevent a critical injury from worsening. Roll **Medicine** (or a relevant skill if using magic or Connection for mental harm).  
- On a success, you keep them alive and buy time for later recovery.  
- See **Harm and Recovery** for full details.  

> You kneel beside your ally, bandaging wounds or calming their mind before it’s too late.

#### Grapple  
Attempt to grab and restrain an opponent. Roll **Might** (you must be unarmed).  
- On success, you and your opponent fall prone, and the opponent drops anything they were holding.  
- While grappling, you may only take Grapple Actions (e.g., attack, pin, disarm).  
- Dropping the hold is a free action.  

> You crash into your foe, locking them in a desperate struggle for control.  

#### Break Free  
Escape a grapple hold. Roll **Might** opposed by your grappler’s **Might**.  
- On success, you break free and may reposition within your zone.  

> You strain against your opponent’s grip, muscles burning until you finally tear yourself loose.  

#### Crawl  
Move while prone. Works like a Mobility action but slower and counts as a major action.  
- Roll **Mobility** if the terrain is difficult or dangerous.  

> You drag yourself through dirt or across the floor, staying low to avoid attacks or stay hidden.  

#### Flee  
Attempt to escape the combat entirely.  
- You must have no enemies at **Arm’s Length** and a clear exit path.  
- Roll **Mobility**.  
- On success, you break away and leave the fight.  

> Heart pounding, you bolt for safety - ducking, dodging, and sprinting until the chaos is behind you.  

#### Reload  
Reload a ranged weapon (crossbow, musket, pistol, etc.).  
- No roll required unless conditions make reloading risky (e.g., under fire, in rough terrain).  

> You fumble for ammo, sliding a bolt or powder charge into place with practiced speed.  

#### Persuade  
Try to talk an opponent into doing something in the heat of battle - surrender, retreat, pause, or help you.
- NPCs may get a save or opposed roll to resist, especially if your request is dangerous or costly.

> You call out over the din, appealing to reason, mercy, or fear to sway your opponent.

#### Taunt
Rattle or provoke your enemy into acting recklessly. Roll **Performance** opposed by their **Insight**.
- On success, choose one:
  - They must target you with their next attack.
  - They act with **disadvantage** on their next action.
- Each additional edge deals 1 mental damage.

> You shout a cutting insult or daring challenge, forcing your foe to react.  

#### Retrieve Item  
Pull something from your gear or pack.  
- Cannot be done if an enemy is at Arm’s Length (unless you choose to risk an attack of opportunity - GM’s call).

> You dig through your gear, searching for the right tool to turn the tide.  

#### Cast Spell  
Unleash a prepared or invoked spell (if you have a magical talent).  
- Follow the rules for your spellcasting tradition.  
- May cost Willpower or trigger stress depending on the magic system in play.  

> You whisper the incantation, weave gestures, or channel raw power - and reality shifts to your will.

### Minor Actions  

Minor actions are quicker, tactical moves you take alongside or instead of a major action. They’re ideal for defending, repositioning, or setting up your next big move.

#### Feint  
Roll **Manipulation** vs. the opponent’s **Insight**.  
- If you win, your opponent must spend an action to dodge or block - even though you don’t actually attack - and you have **advantage** on your next action against that opponent.

> You fake an opening, forcing your enemy to waste time reacting to a strike that never comes.  

#### Run  
Move quickly across the battlefield:

- At any later point this round, you may spend your held major action to make a ranged attack before anything else resolves.  
- You lose your cover if:  
  - You take any other action.  
  - You take damage.
