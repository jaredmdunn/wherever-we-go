# Combat

Combat in *Wherever We Go* is fast, dangerous, and cinematic. Every exchange represents a few seconds of tense action, where characters act boldly, take risks, and deal with the consequences of violence. The rules of combat provide just enough structure to highlight danger, clarify positioning, and give everyone a chance to act.

---

## Rounds & Initiative

Combat is divided into **rounds**, each representing about 5–10 seconds of frantic action. Initiative is handled by **sides**, not individuals: the PCs and their allies act as one group, and the GM’s NPCs act as the opposing group.

At the start of combat, determine who acts first by flipping a coin or calling odds or evens on any die.

The group with initiative keeps it until either:
- A member of the group fails an action (an attack misses, persuasion doesn't land, a run turns into a stumble, etc.)
- An enemy succeeds at a reaction (a block or dodge succeeds, a spell is countered, etc.)
- The group voluntarily give up initiative (to regroup or set up a trap).
- The group runs out of actions.

When initiative shifts, the other side takes over until control shifts again. Within each group’s turn, players (or NPCs) can act in any order they choose.

> **Why This Structure?**
> 
> This system emphasizes momentum and consequence. Initiative flows back and forth based on success and failure, keeping everyone engaged.

### Surprise

If the PCs catch the opposition completely off-guard, they may get a **Surprise Round** before initiative is rolled.  

- Each PC participating in the ambush gets to take **one major or minor action**.
- The opposition cannot react during the Surprise Round.
- After the actions are resolved, roll for initiative as normal.

If any PC fails during the surprise actions, the enemies are alerted and can react immediately, canceling the remaining surprise actions.

**Determining Surprise:**
- For ambushes, make an opposed **Stealth vs. Observation** roll.  
- For sudden attacks in social scenes, make an opposed **Manipulation vs. Insight** roll.  
- Apply **penalties** based on circumstances: distance, noise, cover, or alertness of the enemy.

### Sneak Attacks

A **sneak attack** is a special case where a single PC attacks from hiding or without being detected:  

1. Make a **Stealth roll** (opposed by Observation).
   - **Near range:** roll normally.
   - **Arm’s Length:** roll with a **-3** penalty (closing to strike is harder).
2. On success, you surprise the target and make your attack with **+3**.
3. If you are using a light melee weapon (e.g. dagger, knife), you may roll the attack using **Stealth** instead of **Melee**.

---

## Zones & Ranges

Combat takes place in **zones**, which represent distinct areas on the battlefield: a room, a clearing, or a stretch of ground. Zones help abstract positioning while keeping the fiction clear.

Within zones, combatants interact at different **ranges**:

| Range         | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Arm’s Length** | Close enough to touch, grapple, or strike with a melee weapon. |
| **A Step Away** | Just outside of Arm’s Length - you can close the distance with a single step. Ideal for reach weapons. |
| **Near** | In the same zone but not adjacent - you can reach Arm’s Length with a quick move. |
| **Short** | In an adjacent zone - across a small room, down a hallway, or just beyond a narrow barrier. |
| **Long** | Several zones away (up to four). Crossing the distance usually takes multiple moves or special effort. |
| **Distant** | Far away - across a canyon, on a high balcony, or at the edge of a battlefield. Only the longest-range weapons or magic can reach. |
| **Extreme** | At the limit of sight. Attacks at this range are rarely possible without special equipment or extraordinary effort. |

The GM can adjust the number and size of zones to match the fiction. A close-quarters tavern brawl might be a single zone, while a running fight through city streets might span several.

## Combat Actions

The combat gameflow is still a conversation, but one where **timing**, **risk**, and **spotlight** matter far more than in free play. Instead of rigid action lists, actions are divided into two broad categories based on how much focus they demand:

- **Major Actions** - decisive, high-impact moves that require full commitment.
- **Minor Actions** - quick, reactive, or tactical movements that take less focus.

This distinction is intentionally flexible. The GM may rule that an unusual or cinematic action shifts categories depending on the fiction. What matters most is keeping the scene dynamic and keeping everyone engaged.

Each participant can take **one Major Action and one Minor Action**, **or two Minor Actions**, each round. Some abilities, talents, or conditions may modify this.

> **How to Determine Major vs Minor vs Free Actions**
>
> After the player describes what they want to accomplish, it is ultimately up to the GM to decide what kind of action it is. An ability or effect may make it clear what kind of action it is already, however if it doesn't, here are some guiding principles:
>
> - **Attacking** actions are typically **major** actions.
> - **Defensive** reactions are typically **minor** actions.
> - **Movement** actions (e.g., moving from one zone to another, repositioning within a zone, standing from prone, etc.) are typically **minor** actions, *unless the movement is difficult* (e.g., climbing, rough terrain, crawling, etc.).
> - **Readying** actions (e.g., drawing a weapon or item, reloading, preparing spell ingredients or a spellbook, picking up an item, etc.) are typically **minor** actions.
> - **Tactical** actions (e.g., reading the room, shoving, disarming, charging, setting up an ally, swinging a weapon for an added boost, etc.) are typically **minor** actions.
> 
> Almost every action should be either a minor or a major action, however some things like dropping items or shouting a few words are considered **free** actions. Certain abilities may also grant you a free action of some kind. Being granted something as a free action can be extremely powerful.

## Attacks, Defense, and Opposed Rolls

Any time one creature directly targets another in combat—striking, shooting, shoving, grappling, taunting, or persuading—you resolve it as an **attack** against a **defender**.

- **Attacking Actions** are usually **major actions**.
- **Defensive reactions** (blocking, dodging) are usually **minor actions**.
- **Opposed rolls** are special contests where only the acting creature spends an action (see below).

### Step-by-step Attack Sequence

1. **Declare the attack**
   - The attacker says what they do and who they target (e.g., “I swing my axe at the raider” or “I fire at the sniper in the window”).
   - The GM confirms the range, positioning, and any situational modifiers (cover, visibility, movement, etc.).

2. **Check for a defense**
   - If the target has a **minor action** available, they may choose to defend with a **Block** or **Dodge**.
   - If they **cannot or choose not to defend**, the attack is **undefended** (see Hit & Damage below).

3. **Build the dice pools**
   - **Attacker** gathers dice based on the type of attack:
     - **Melee** for melee weapons.
     - **Marksmanship** for ranged weapons.
     - **Might** for unarmed strikes.
   - Apply any bonuses/penalties from range, cover, movement, conditions, or talents.
   - If a relevant talent applies, add the **talent die**.
   - The attacker may spend **1 Willpower** to add **stress dice**, following the normal rules for pushing/gambling.
   - **Defender** (if they are defending) gathers dice:
     - **Melee** (or **Might** if unarmed) to **Block** or parry.
     - **Mobility** to **Dodge**.
   - Apply bonuses/penalties for terrain, cover, conditions, or talents.
   - Defenders **cannot** add stress dice and **cannot push or gamble** on defense.

4. **Roll**
   - Both attacker and defender (if defending) roll their pools **at the same time**.

5. **Compare edges**
   - Count the **edges** on each roll.
   - If the attacker has **at least one more edge** than the defender, the attack **hits**.
   - If the defender has equal or more edges, the attack **misses**.
   - If the attack was **undefended**, the attacker only needs **one edge** to hit.

6. **Gambling on the attack**
   - If the attack **misses**, the attacker may choose to **gamble** (see *Pushing, Gambling, and Stress*):
     - Increase their **stress** by 1.
     - Add 1 stress die to the pool.
     - Reroll all dice except any stress dice showing **1s** (banes stay locked).
   - Defenders **never** gamble or push when defending.

7. **Hit & damage**
   - On a hit, start with the weapon’s **base damage**.
   - Add **+1 damage for each edge beyond the first** (a 3-edge success deals base damage +2).

8. **Armor roll**
   - If the defender has armor, they make a **D20 armor roll** to see if the blow strikes a protected location.
   - If the roll is **equal to or under** the coverage of **any** piece of armor the defender is wearing, that armor’s **damage value** is subtracted from the incoming damage.
     - If multiple pieces could apply (e.g., helmet and body armor), use the **highest single damage value**; armor damage values do **not** stack.

### Opposed Rolls vs Defending

Some actions call for an **opposed roll** (e.g., two creatures wrestling over an object, a feint vs. Insight).

- An opposed roll only costs an action for the **acting creature** (the one initiating the move).
- The other creature **does not** spend an action; they simply roll to resist.
- This is different from a **defensive reaction**, which **does** cost the defender a minor action to block or dodge an incoming attack.

Use opposed rolls when two creatures are actively **contesting the same goal** (grappling, tug-of-war, outwitting), and defensive reactions when one creature is simply **trying not to be harmed**.

---

## Melee Combat

Melee combat happens at **Arm’s Length** or **A Step Away** and is where shoves, grapples, and blades come into play. Use the attack sequence above, with **Melee** or **Might** as the primary skills.

### Typical Melee Exchange

1. **Close in:** If needed, the attacker uses movement (often a minor action) to get to **Arm’s Length**.
2. **Declare the attack:** The attacker describes a basic swing, thrust, punch, or kick.
3. **Defender chooses a reaction:** If they have a minor action available, they may:
   - **Block** with a parrying weapon, shield, or bare arms using **Melee** or **Might**.
   - **Dodge** by slipping aside or dropping low using **Mobility**.
4. **Build dice pools and roll:** Follow the **Attacks, Defense, and Opposed Rolls** procedure.
5. **Resolve damage and armor:** Apply damage, then roll for armor coverage as normal.

This covers the bread-and-butter of melee: trading blows at close range.

### Blocking vs Dodging

- **Block (Reaction, Minor Action)**
  - Uses **Melee** (or **Might** if unarmed).
  - Represents parrying, absorbing, or catching the blow on a shield or braced limb.
  - You usually stay in place and keep pressure on the foe.

- **Dodge (Reaction, Minor Action)**
  - Uses **Mobility**.
  - Represents slipping, rolling, or leaping out of the way.
  - The GM may rule that a particularly dramatic dodge leaves you **prone** or changes your position within the zone.

Both are valid choices; blocking is steadier and works well with heavy armor and shields, while dodging shines for lightly armoured, mobile characters.

### Special Melee Options

The following options build on the basic attack sequence and are reflected in the action tables:

- **Shove (usually Minor Action)**
  - Roll **Melee** or **Might** vs the target’s **Melee**, **Might**, or **Mobility** (GM’s call).
  - On a success, you **push** the target back (often from Arm’s Length to A Step Away or into another zone) or **knock them prone**.

- **Disarm (Minor Action)**
  - Roll **Melee** (or **Might** if unarmed) vs the target’s **Melee**.
  - On a success, the target **drops a held weapon or item**; picking it back up typically costs a minor action.

- **Grapple (Major Action)**
  - Roll **Might** vs the target’s **Might** or **Mobility**.
  - On a success, you **grapple** the target: they are held at **Arm’s Length**, cannot move freely, and many actions become harder or impossible without first breaking free.

- **Grapple Attack (Minor Action)**
  - While you are already grappling a target, you may attack them using **Might**.
  - On a hit, you deal damage, representing chokes, joint locks, or close-in strikes.

- **Break Free (Major Action)**
  - The grappled creature rolls **Might** vs the grappler’s **Might**.
  - On a success, they escape the grapple and may reposition within the zone as appropriate.

These options keep melee dynamic—creatures aren’t just trading hits, they’re tackling, throwing, dragging, and creating space.

## Ranged Combat

Ranged attacks let characters threaten enemies across zones, control space, and strike from safety—but they come with tradeoffs. Shots are sensitive to range, cover, and movement; closing foes, bad positioning, or running out of ammo can quickly turn a sharpshooter’s advantage into a desperate scramble.

Ranged attacks primarily use **Marksmanship** and are affected by the **range bands** from *Zones & Ranges*.

### Typical Ranged Exchange

1. **Ready or Load**
   - Some weapons must be **readied** (knocking an arrow, fitting a rock into a sling) as a minor action.
   - Some weapons must be **reloaded** (loading a musket, cranking up a crossbow) as a minor or major action (depending on the weapon).

2. **Aim (optional)**
   - You may spend a **minor action** to **Aim**, lining up your shot.
   - Aimed shots typically gain a +2.

3. **Attack**
   - Make a **Ranged Attack** as a **major action** using **Marksmanship**.
   - The target may choose to **Dodge** if they have a minor action and the fiction allows it (cover, movement, awareness).
     - Depending on the attacking weapon, the target may also **Block** but typically only with a shield.
   - Build dice pools and resolve the attack following **Attacks, Defense, and Opposed Rolls**.

4. **Resolve damage, armor, and ammo**
   - Apply damage, then roll for armor coverage as usual.
   - Check ammunition (see below).

### Readying, Loading, and Reloading

- **Quick weapons** (bows, pistols, some crossbows) usually:
  - Draw: minor action.
  - Ready/knock/load: minor action.
  - Fire: major action.

- **Slow or heavy weapons** (muskets, heavy crossbows, complicated firearms) may:
  - Require a **major action** to reload after each shot.
  - Leave you vulnerable while reloading, encouraging allies or cover.

The specific weapon entry will state how much time reloading and readying require; use the tables here as the default.

### Ammunition

After each shot (or after each fight, depending on the weapon), roll your ammo’s **resource die** (D6–D12). On a **1–2**, the die steps down one size. When it’s gone, you’re **out of ammo** and must resupply.

Characters under pressure might fire more quickly, roll the ammo die more often, or risk losing track of ammo in the chaos—this is a good place for the GM to lean on the fiction.

### Cover, Movement, and Shooting into Melee

The GM may grant bonuses or impose penalties based on:

- **Visibility:** fog, darkness, smoke, blinding light.
- **Cover:** shooting around corners, through arrow slits, or over barricades.
- **Target size and movement:** small, nimble, or fast-moving targets are harder to hit.
- **Shooting into melee:** firing into a scrum is risky; on a miss, the GM may allow the shot to threaten an ally or a different target in the melee.

Use these factors to make ranged combat feel sharp and tactical without bogging down in modifiers.

## Weapons & Armor

Weapons and armor in *Wherever We Go* are extensions of the fiction first and foremost. The same rules can cover a barbarian’s axe, a detective’s pistol, a rebel’s blaster, or a diver’s pressure suit.

Just like other pieces of equipment, weapons and armor have reliability and size ratings.

### Weapons

#### Damage
Weapons list a **base damage** (usually 1–4). On a successful attack, deal base damage **+1** per additional edge.

#### Weapon Tactics

Weapon tactics are **specific attack options** that become available when you have the right weapon and, in some cases, the right **talent**. Instead of passively sitting on your character sheet, these tactics are things you **declare** when you attack.

When you make an attack with a weapon that lists a tactic, you may choose **one** of its available tactics and describe how it shows up in the fiction. On a hit, you apply both **normal damage** and the tactic’s **extra effect**.

Examples of common tactics:

- **Bleed**
  - On a hit, the target begins bleeding: they lose **1 Health per round** until stabilized or treated.
  - Effective for knives, serrated blades, and vicious arrows.

- **Pierce Armor**
  - On a hit, the attack is especially good at bypassing protection.
  - The defender makes the **D20 armor roll with disadvantage** (roll twice, take the higher result).
  - Suits armor-piercing rounds, spears, and weapons that slip through gaps.

- **Execution**
  - Designed to finish helpless or badly injured targets.
  - Against a **Broken**, restrained, or unaware target, the attack may force their **Death save with disadvantage** (roll twice, take the lower result).

- **Stun**
  - On a hit, the target must succeed on an appropriate roll (often **Endurance**).
  - On a failure, they **lose their next minor action** or suffer another short impairment (GM’s call).

Some advanced tactics are only available if you have a **specific talent**, represent specialized training, or require particular environmental set-ups (e.g., charging with a polearm, using a net, or performing a spinning strike). Weapon and talent entries will call these out explicitly.

### Armor

#### Coverage
Armor lists a coverage score (1-15). This number represents the chance that any given successful attack will hit the armor.

When an attack hits, the attacker rolls a **D20 armor roll**:

- If the result is **equal to or under** your armor’s **coverage**, the blow lands on that piece of armor.
- If you wear multiple pieces (e.g., a helmet and body armor), any piece whose coverage is **equal to or above** the roll could be hit.
- In that case, you apply the **single highest damage value** among the eligible pieces; armor damage values do **not** stack.

#### Damage
Armor has a **damage score** that indicates how much damage it blocks if the attack hits the armor:

- If the armor roll shows the attack struck armor, **subtract the armor’s damage score** from the incoming damage.
- Damage cannot go below 0; any remaining damage is applied to the target as normal.
- If any damage goes through the armor, **subtract the amount of damage that went through from armor's reliability score**.
  - If the reliability score is reduced to half its full value, its damage score is reduced by half.
  - If the reliability score is reduced to 0, the armor is broken and cannot be used.

Some weapon tactics, talents, or abilities may **ignore armor**, **reduce its coverage**, or only apply their full effect if the blow bypasses armor. Those exceptions are noted in the relevant weapon or talent descriptions.
