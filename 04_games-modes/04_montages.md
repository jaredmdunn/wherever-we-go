# Montages

A **montage** is used whenever the story needs to cover a stretch of time without playing out every moment scene by scene. This might be a journey across a dangerous region, weeks spent working on personal projects, or the quiet period between two major missions.

Montages let each character take meaningful actions while keeping the story moving forward. They are a tool for zooming out, focusing on each character in turn, and giving everyone a chance to show what they’re doing during the downtime or journey.

## Setting Up a Montage

When entering a montage, the GM works with the players to set the **scope of time** and a **montage clock** to represent how much time passes before the next big event pulls the characters back into free play.

### Typical montage clocks:

- **Short Montage:** 1 tick per player. A day or two, a short trip, or a single night.
- **Standard Montage:** 2 ticks per player. A few days to a few weeks, a significant journey or downtime period.
- **Long Montage:** 3 ticks per player. Several weeks or months of downtime, an expedition, or a long-term break from action.

The length of the clock should match the fictional time being skipped-if a month passes, the montage should feel big enough to cover that.

## Taking Montage Actions

Each player describes what their character does during the montage-alone, with allies, or even with NPCs. The GM may ask for **action rolls** if the outcome is uncertain or risky.

Each montage action fills **1 tick** on the montage clock by default. More complicated actions (like a dangerous expedition or building a major project) may take **2 or 3 ticks** at the GM’s discretion.

Examples of montage actions:

- Healing or working to recover from harm.
- Working off stress.
- Training a skill or talent.
- Crafting or repairing equipment.
- Making social visits, building alliances, or gathering rumors.
- Performing research, magical study, or meditation.
- Traveling through dangerous terrain.

When the clock is full, time advances and something happens to bring the game back to **free play**: a new opportunity appears, trouble catches up with the characters, or they arrive at their destination.

## Complications and Benefits

Montages aren’t just quiet bookkeeping-they can lead to new drama or opportunities. As players make rolls during a montage, the GM can introduce **complications** or **benefits**:

- **Complications:** The project takes longer, resources run short, rivals interfere, or new dangers appear.
- **Benefits:** The project finishes faster, the journey is easier than expected, or the characters find something unexpected and valuable.

Montages are an opportunity for the GM to advance world events, reveal threats, or set up the next big scene.

## Using Montages for Journeys

Montages are especially helpful for travel. Each player can describe how their character contributes to the journey-scouting ahead, cooking for the group, standing watch, or simply entertaining their companions. The montage clock ensures the journey feels like time is passing, and events can occur along the way:

- Bad weather or dangerous obstacles.
- Discoveries or landmarks along the route.
- Bandits, wild beasts, or natural hazards.
- Personal moments between characters.

## Ending the Montage

Once the clock is full, the GM transitions back into free play or mission mode. Often, this moment feels like a turning point:

- The characters arrive at their destination.
- The downtime ends as trouble finds them.
- A faction’s plan comes to fruition.
- Their work pays off-or fails dramatically.

Montages should leave the players excited to see what happens next, not bogged down in logistics.
