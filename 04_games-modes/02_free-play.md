# Free Play  

Free play is the **default mode of play** in *Wherever We Go*. This is where characters talk, explore, make choices, and live their lives moment to moment. There’s no special structure or clock—just the ongoing conversation between players and the GM.  

Free play is flexible. It can be lighthearted banter around the campfire, tense negotiations with a rival faction, or an impromptu investigation of a strange sound in the woods. It’s the connective tissue of the game, linking together missions, montages, and combat with open-ended play.

## When to Use Free Play  

Any time the story isn’t in a mission, montage, or combat, you are in free play. It’s the space where players can:  

- Explore locations, talk to NPCs, and ask questions.
- Pursue personal goals and interact with the world.
- Make decisions that lead to the next big scene or mission.
- Investigate clues, gather information, or plot their next move.

## The Conversation  

Free play is still a structured conversation, even if it’s looser than other modes. The GM sets the scene and asks, **“What do you do?”** Players respond, describing their actions in the fiction.  

When an action has a meaningful chance of risk, cost, or consequence, the GM calls for an **action roll**. Otherwise, the action simply succeeds—no roll needed.  

> **GM Tip:**  
> 
> Use free play to highlight character relationships, introduce new hooks, and reveal information about the setting. Ask open-ended questions:  
> - “Who do you go to for help with this?”  
> - “What’s the first thing you notice about this place?”  
> - “Why does this problem matter to you personally?”

## Pacing in Free Play  

Free play can run at whatever pace the story demands. You can zoom in on tense conversations or fast-forward through travel and small talk to focus on the next dramatic moment.  

As a GM, keep an ear out for natural transition points:  
- When the players commit to a plan, shift into a **mission**.  
- When time needs to pass, start a **montage**.  
- When danger strikes, enter **combat**.  

The goal is to let free play breathe while keeping the story moving forward.

## Player Agency  

Free play is where players have the most freedom to steer the story. They can split the party, pursue separate goals, or simply talk things out. Encourage players to:  

- Declare what they want to do or learn.  
- Seek out NPCs or locations that interest them.  
- Share what their character is thinking or feeling.  

The GM should respond by putting the world in motion—letting NPCs react, presenting opportunities, and showing the consequences of the players’ choices.

## Free Play and Risk  

Even though free play is less structured, risk is still present. A poor roll might lead to harm, new complications, or the revelation of danger that pushes the group toward a mission or combat.  

Think of free play as the space where tension builds—sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly—until it tips into a more structured mode.

## Transitioning Out of Free Play  

When the characters take decisive action that changes the situation—launching a heist, striking an enemy, beginning a dangerous journey—the table shifts into a different mode.  

Free play doesn’t end abruptly; it *flows* naturally into mission, montage, or combat as the fiction demands.  

> **GM Tip:**  
> 
> If play feels stalled, use free play to introduce a new opportunity, threat, or dilemma. Give the players a clear decision point: something they must respond to that will carry them into the next phase of play.
