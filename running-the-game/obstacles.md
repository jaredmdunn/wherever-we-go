# Obstacles

## Falling

When you fall onto a hard surface, you automatically suffer damage equal to the distance fallen in feet divided by three (rounded down). For a controlled jump, make a Mobility roll; each edge reduces the damage by one.

## Explosions

Explosions are rated by *blast power*. For each creature within range of the blast, roll the explosion’s blast power. On the first edge, the target suffers the base damage of the explosion and for each extra edge, the target suffers an additional point of damage to Health. Targets at arm’s length from the blast suffer one extra point of damage automatically. All targets must make an Endurance roll (not an action) to not be knocked prone. Powerful explosions may also cause falling or fire hazards according the GM's discretion or the item's description.

| Blast Power | Base Damage* | Descriptor | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2D6 | 1 | Small  | Grenade, small charge | 
| 2D8 | 2 | Moderate | Barrel, large charge |
| 2D10 | 3 | Powerful | Car bomb, big spell |
| 2D12 | 4 | Devastating | Massive explosion |

> *The number of zones affected by an explosion is equal to its Base Damage.

## Fire

When exposed to fire, roll for its intensity. For each edge rolled by the fire’s die, you suffer one point of damage to Health. If you take damage, you catch fire and suffer another fire attack at the start of each round, with the intensity increasing by one step each round. A fire goes out automatically after a round in which it causes no damage, or you (or an ally at arm’s length) can put it out with a successful Mobility roll as a full action. Using a blanket or similar item gives a +2 bonus to this roll.

## Poison

## Drugs

## Drowning and Suffocation

If you are underwater or otherwise can't breath, make an **Endurance** check each round (free action) to hold your breath. On a failure, you start to drown, taking one damage to Health every round until you can get a breath or are Broken.
