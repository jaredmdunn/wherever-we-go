# NPCs

Non-player characters (NPCs) fill your world with allies, rivals, monsters, and everyone in between. They follow the same core rules as player characters when they matter in the fiction, but you usually use simplified stat blocks so they are fast and fun to run.

The most important things about any NPC are:

1. **Name** - something that is easy to say and remember.
2. **Description** - a few vivid details: voice, posture, signature gear, or habits.
3. **Motives** - what they want right now, what they fear, and who they care about.

Everything else (stats, talents, gear) exists to support those three things at the table.

## Types of NPCs

There are two main tiers of NPCs: **main** NPCs and **side** NPCs.

### Main NPCs

Main NPCs are central allies, major villains, or recurring rivals. They are important enough that you want them to feel like full characters.

- **Build like PCs.** Give them attributes, skills, talents, Health, Resolve, gear, and any other relevant details.
- **Use all the rules.** Main NPCs can **push**, **gamble**, track stress and willpower, suffer harm, and so on—just like player characters.
- **Play to their motives.** Their goals and relationships drive scenes; their stats simply say how effective they are.

Use main NPCs sparingly so they stay special and do not slow the game down.

### Side NPCs

Side NPCs are everyone else: guards, innkeepers, background villains, one-off creatures, and minor recurring characters. They use a small stat block so you can run many of them quickly.

- **Stats:** Side NPCs have two stats: **Body** and **Mind**.
- **Dice:** Each stat is rated with one or two dice from **1D6** up to **2D12**.
- **Talents:** They may also have a few talents that grant extra dice when relevant.
- **Conversion:** If a side NPC becomes central to the story, you can promote them to a main NPC between sessions by fleshing out their full character sheet.

When a side NPC attempts something where the outcome matters to the PCs, roll:

- **Body** for physical actions (fighting, climbing, chasing, enduring hardship).
- **Mind** for mental, social, or magical actions (persuading, noticing details, keeping calm).

Side NPCs generally do **not** track willpower or stress. They also do not usually **push** or **gamble**, although you can treat an especially fearsome foe as a main NPC and use the full rules.

As a rule of thumb, **don’t roll for NPCs unless it directly affects the PCs**. If only NPCs are acting against each other, decide the outcome based on their stats, the fiction, and what will make the story more interesting.

## Quick NPC Stat Blocks

For most NPCs, you can use a compact format:

- **Name & role** - who they are in the story.
- **Look & manner** - 2-3 details that make them easy to portray.
- **Motives** - what they want, what they fear, and who they serve or oppose.
- **Body / Mind** - their two core stats.
- **Talents** - a couple of things they are especially good at.
- **Health / Resolve** - how much harm they can take.
- **Notes** - connections to PCs, secrets, or special moves.

Example:

- **Name:** Captain Mira Thorn  
  **Role:** Harbor guard captain, loyal to the city but suspicious of outsiders  
  **Body:** 2D8 **Mind:** 2D6  
  **Talents:** Sword Master (D8), Veteran Investigator (D6)  
  **Health:** 16 **Resolve:** 12  
  **Motives:** Keep the docks safe, protect her crew, uncover smuggling rings.

Use this format in your notes or index cards so you can grab and run an NPC in seconds.

## Choosing Body and Mind

If an NPC might need to roll, assign **Body** and **Mind** dice to reflect how capable they are:

- **1D6** - very weak or inept; untrained commoner, frightened child.
- **2D6** - normal adult, not competent in stressful situations.
- **2D8** - average competent professional, trained guard, minor mage.
- **2D10** - exceptional expert, veteran warrior, master scholar.
- **2D12** - force of nature; legendary hero, demigod, or terrifying monster.

If you are unsure, start with **2D8** for a typical person and step up or down depending on the NPC’s role in the story.

## Talents

Talents represent things an NPC is especially good at—skills, training, magical gifts, or unusual advantages. Talents work like PC talents: when a talent is clearly relevant to an action, add the talent die to the roll.

Give most side NPCs **1-3 talents**. Keep them broad and evocative rather than narrow and technical.

Examples:

- **Sword Fighter (D8)**
- **Acrobat (D6)**
- **Diplomat (D12)**
- **Tracker (D6)**
- **Silver Tongue (D8)**
- **Battle Mage (D10)**

Write talents in plain language so it is obvious when they apply.

---

## Health and Resolve

NPCs use **Health** for physical harm and **Resolve** for mental or emotional harm.

For side NPCs, you can derive their resilience directly from their Body and Mind dice:

- **Health = Body dice × Body die size**  
  - Example: **2D8 Body → Health 16** (2 × 8).
- **Resolve = Mind dice × Mind die size**  
  - Example: **2D12 Mind → Resolve 24** (2 × 12).

You can adjust these values up or down if the fiction demands it—fragile but deadly assassins, tireless constructs, or especially stubborn zealots.

When an NPC takes harm, reduce Health or Resolve according to the damage rules. Most side NPCs are taken out of a scene once they are Broken; you rarely need to track long-term injuries for them unless they are important to the story.

## Animals

Animals mostly work like normal NPCs, with a few tweaks:

- **Strong bodies, simple minds.** Animals usually have higher **Body** and lower **Mind**.
- **Natural behaviors.** Apply penalties when animals attempt things not in their nature, and bonuses when they work *with* their instincts.
- **Instinctive talents.** Give them animal-specific talents like **Tracker**, **War-Trained**, **Keen Senses**, or **Pack Hunter**.

Example:

- **Warhorse** - Body 2D10, Mind 1D6; Talents: War-Trained (D8), Sure-Footed (D6).
- **Wolf** - Body 2D8, Mind 1D6; Talents: Tracker (D6), Pack Hunter (D6), Keen Senses (D6).

Use animals to reinforce the tone of the world—loyal companions, terrifying predators, or mysterious wilderness presences.

## Monsters, Spirits, Immortals, and Gods

Monsters, spirits, immortals, and gods are not regular NPCs. They are **forces of nature** that shape the world and the story.

- **Unkillable or nearly so.** They may only be defeated by specific rituals, items, or fictional positioning, not by grinding down a big pile of Health.
- **Superhuman stats.** When they do use dice, they often sit at the top of the scale (2D12 or beyond), but the real threat is usually in their fictional power.
- **Mythic presence.** Meeting one should feel like entering a legend, not just starting another combat.

They rarely have to roll to do things. Instead, **the PCs roll to deal with the consequences** of their actions: surviving their wrath, resisting their influence, or seizing an opportunity against impossible odds.
