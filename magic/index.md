# Magic

Magic works differently from other talents:

When you cast a spell, you make a casting roll with a number of dice equal to the amount of WP that you spend on the spell. The first die that you roll is always your Magic Talent die (as defined by your Magic Talent). Any additional dice are D6s. Spending more WP to roll more dice increases the chance of overcharging your spell and the risk of a magical mishap.

OR

Roll Attribute + Magic Talent

More powerful magic should be riskier

More powerful magic should be risker for those less experienced

Any spell can be learned (may be harder for some more than others)

IDEAS:
- the rank of the spell equals the numbers on the dice that result in a mishap
  - this only applies to the magic talent die
  - Means that higher ranked spells are riskier but not as risky for higher ranked sorcerers
- Every spell costs 1 WP to cast. Additional WP can be spent to lower the number that triggers a magical mishap. Cannot be lowered below 1.
  - There could be different features based on the "class" of magic (e.g., ingredients, taking harm, etc.)
- Base power of a spell is also equivalent to its rank --> any edges roll boost the power of the spell
- Spells that modify another spell (e.g., Obscure Magic) require an additional 1 WP to cast and the potential mishap is the sum of the ranks of the two spells.


- ??roll a d20 against the value of the casting roll to determine something??
  - Maybe a d12 instead - maybe not needed at all
