# Harm and Recovery

Danger, risk, and the chance of getting hurt are a natural part of adventure. *Wherever We Go* uses **harm** to represent the lasting consequences of those risks-whether wounds, fear, exhaustion, or emotional strain-and **recovery** to represent the time and effort it takes to get back on your feet. Harm raises the stakes of the story, while recovery creates space for quieter moments of reflection, growth, and care.

## Harm

Harm tracks the lasting consequences of danger. It isn’t meant to punish you, but to make risks meaningful and create opportunities for drama and tension. Harm affects what you can do until it’s treated, but it also tells the story of the hardships you’ve endured.

### Categories of Harm

Harm of all types is tracked on a single harm track with the following rows:

- **Minor Harm (3 rows):** Small injuries that make actions harder or slower.  
  Examples: *Bruised, Distracted, Winded, Shaken.*
  - Each Minor harm gives a **–1 penalty** to a different skill.

- **Major Harm (2 rows):** Significant injuries or trauma that meaningfully impair you.  
  Examples: *Deep Cut, Concussed, Panicked, Enraged, Terrified.*  
  - Each Major harm gives a **–2 penalty** to a different skill.

- **Severe Harm (1 row):** Serious wounds or breakdowns that render you unable to act until treated.  
  Examples: *Broken Arm, Impaled, Dissociating.*  
  - A Severe harm imposes a **–3 penalty** to an entire attribute (and all skills linked to it).

- **Critical Harm (1 row):** Catastrophic injury or trauma that leaves you **Broken**-unconscious, incapacitated, or on the brink of death.

If you must take harm and there’s no space at the appropriate category, it escalates to the next one. If all rows are full, the harm becomes permanent injury, complete collapse, or death.

### Thresholds

When harm is inflicted, compare the incoming damage to the appropriate **thresholds** to determine how severe it is. Each threshold marks the **boundary between two harm categories**. Crossing a threshold moves the harm to the next category.

Each threshold is based on either your **Body** (Strength + Dexterity) or **Mind** (Intuition + Wits).

- **Minor/Major Threshold:** Body or Mind ÷ 6 (rounded down)  
- **Major/Severe Threshold:** Body or Mind ÷ 4 (rounded down)  
- **Severe/Critical Threshold:** Body or Mind ÷ 2 (rounded down)

If the incoming damage meets or exceeds a threshold, your harm moves into that higher category.

#### Example 1: Physical Harm
*(Strength = D10 and Dexterity = D8 → Body = 18)*

- **Minor/Major Threshold:** 18 ÷ 6 = **3**
- **Major/Severe Threshold:** 18 ÷ 4 = **4**
- **Severe/Critical Threshold:** 18 ÷ 2 = **9**

| Damage | Harm Category | Harm Descriptor | Cause | Effect |
|--- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1–2 | **Minor** | *Bruised* | Bashed with a shield | -1 to Force |
| 3–8 | **Major** | *Concussed* | Rifle butt to the head | -2 to Observation |
| 9+ | **Severe** | *Shattered Arm* | Jumping out of a building | -3 to Strength |

#### Example 2: Mental Harm  
*(Intuition = D8 and Wits = D6 → Mind = 14)*

- **Minor/Major Threshold:** 14 ÷ 6 = **2**
- **Major/Severe Threshold:** 14 ÷ 4 = **3**
- **Severe/Critical Threshold:** 14 ÷ 2 = **7**

| Damage | Harm Category | Harm Descriptor | Cause | Effect 
|--- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Minor** | *Distracted* | Inhaled an intoxicating perfume | -1 to Observation |
| 2–6 | **Major** | *Panicked* | The bridge behind you collapsed, leaving no escape | -2 to Insight |
| 7+ | **Severe** | *Dissociating* | Looked at the face of the God of Death | -3 to Intuition |

### Harm Table

Use the harm table to record lasting injuries, conditions, or emotional states. You don’t need to track thresholds-just the fictional results (for example, *Bruised*, *Distracted*, *Concussed*).

## Becoming Broken

When you suffer **Critical harm**, you become **Broken**-unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to act.

- **Incapacitated:** While Broken, you are unconscious or unable to meaningfully act until stabilized.  
- **Death Save:** When you become Broken, roll a **D20**.
  - On a **1**, you face death or an equally catastrophic fate (GM discretion).
  - If you roll **less than or equal to the damage you just took**, you suffer a **permanent injury**.
  - If you roll **greater than the damage**, you’re incapacitated but stable.

If your Death Save triggers consequences (death or permanent injury), roll a **D6**-this creates a **countdown clock**. Every roll made by anyone (PC or NPC) fills a segment. When it fills, the consequences take effect. This gives allies a chance to intervene.

### Stabilizing the Broken

A first aid attempt can be made to help a Broken character (usually **Medicine** for physical harm or **Connection** for mental harm).

- Only **one first aid attempt** may be made (others can assist).
- Add the number of **edges** rolled on this attempt to the result of the Death Save.
  - If the original roll was a **1**, any number of edges saves the character’s life.
  - If the adjusted result still falls below the damage taken, the character still suffers a permanent injury.

### Permanent Injury

A **permanent injury** represents lasting damage-physical or mental-that will never fully heal. Mechanically, it means you **step down one attribute die** (Strength, Dexterity, Intuition, or Wits-whichever fits the fiction). This also alters your resistance thresholds.

Permanent injuries should also have narrative impact:

- **Physical:** A limp, a missing finger, an old wound that never healed.
- **Mental:** Nightmares, paranoia, memory loss, or a new phobia.

If stepping down an attribute would take it from **D6 to 0**, the character dies-or meets an equally irreversible fate agreed upon by the table.

Becoming Broken should always feel like a dramatic turning point-an opportunity for the table to decide together what this moment means for the story.

## Recovery

Healing harm takes time, care, and often the help of others. Recovery is tracked on a **4-segment healing clock**, representing your progress back to health.

### How Healing Works

Recovery is typically attempted as part of a **montage**, when the group has time to rest, regroup, and pursue their own goals. You can usually attempt recovery no more than **twice per montage**.

Someone must tend to your wounds or mental state. This typically uses **Medicine** for physical injuries or **Connection** for emotional or mental recovery.

The healer rolls, and you mark a number of segments equal to the **edges** rolled:

- **0 edges:** No progress.
- **1 edge:** Mark 1 segment.
- **2 edges:** Mark 2 segments.
- **3+ edges:** Mark 3 segments.

When the clock fills, reduce every harm by one category (Critical → Severe → Major → Minor → Healed) and clear the clock. Any extra progress carries over to a new clock.

### Examples of Recovery

- **Severe Harm** (*Broken Arm*) becomes **Major Harm** (*Splinted Arm*).  
- **Major Harm** (*Concussed*) becomes **Minor Harm** (*Headache*).  
- **Minor Harm** (*Bruised*) is cleared completely.

### First Aid

Immediate first aid can’t reduce harm categories but can stabilize a character to prevent death, permanent injury, or total collapse. Examples:

- Binding wounds to stop bleeding.  
- Splinting a limb so it can be moved safely.  
- Talking down a panicked ally so they can act again.

This buys time until proper recovery can happen during a montage.

### Self-Healing

You can try to heal yourself, but it’s harder and riskier. The GM may impose disadvantage, reduced effect, or new complications such as infection, lingering trauma, or worsening injury.

### Setbacks

Whenever you suffer new harm, erase any progress on your healing clock. Recovery is fragile-fresh injuries undo days or weeks of healing.

### Recovery in the Fiction

Recovery isn’t just mechanical. Use these moments to show how you heal-quiet nights with a healer, whispered prayers, moments of bonding, or reflection. These scenes can reveal growth, deepen relationships, or open new story hooks.
