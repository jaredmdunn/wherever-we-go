# Harm and Recovery

Danger, risk, and the chance of getting hurt are natural parts of adventure. *Wherever We Go* uses **harm** to represent the lasting consequences of those risks—whether wounds, fear, exhaustion, or emotional strain—and **recovery** to represent the time and effort it takes to get back on your feet. Harm raises the stakes of the story, while recovery creates space for quieter moments of reflection, growth, and care.

---

## Harm

Harm tracks the lasting consequences of danger. It isn’t meant to punish you, but to make risks meaningful and create opportunities for drama and tension. Harm affects what you can do until it’s treated, but it also tells the story of the hardships you’ve endured.

### Health and Resolve

Characters have two pools that represent their physical and mental endurance:

- **Health = Strength + Agility** — measures your physical resilience.
- **Resolve = Wits + Empathy** — measures your emotional and mental fortitude.

Physical harm reduces **Health**.
Mental harm reduces **Resolve**.
If either one is reduced to **0**, you become **Broken**.

## Taking Harm

When you take damage, compare the total to the following scale to determine the severity:

| Damage | Harm Category | Description | Effect |
|--------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | Weakened | Temporary fatigue or strain—no lasting harm. | Narrative only. |
| 2–3 | Minor | Bruises, scrapes, or emotional strain. | **–1 to a skill.** |
| 4–5 | Severe | Deep injury or trauma that interferes with action. | **–2 to a skill.** |
| 6+ | Major | Potentially fatal or shattering harm. | **–3 to an attribute.** |

> Injury penalties do **not stack**—only the **worst penalty** applies at a time.
> However, harm penalties do stack with other sources of penalties.

There is **no limit** to how much harm you can suffer. Each new wound adds to the narrative and increases the pressure on the group, but penalties do not multiply.

## Becoming Broken

You become **Broken** when your **Health** or **Resolve** reaches **0**.

Being Broken means you are **unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to act**.
You are on the brink of death or complete collapse.

### Death Save

When you become Broken, roll a **D20**:

- On a **1**, you die or suffer an equally catastrophic fate (GM discretion).
- If you roll **less than or equal to the damage just taken**, you suffer a **permanent injury**.
- Otherwise, you are **stable but unconscious**. You become conscious again 

### Permanent Injury

A permanent injury represents lasting damage—physical or mental—that will never fully heal.

- **Effect:** Step down one **attribute die** (e.g., Strength D8 → D6).
- **If this would reduce an attribute below D6**, your character dies or is permanently removed from play.

Permanent injuries should have narrative weight:
- **Physical:** A limp, a missing finger, chronic pain.
- **Mental:** Nightmares, phobia, paranoia, or loss of confidence.

## Recovery

Healing harm takes time, rest, and care. Recovery uses a **2-segment healing clock** to track progress.

### Healing Process

When the group rests or takes downtime (a **montage**), you may attempt recovery.
Someone must tend to your wounds or mental state, using **Medicine** for physical harm or **Connection** for mental harm.

- Mark a number of **segments equal to the edges** rolled. If you roll greater than two edges, those edges carry over.

When the clock fills, all harm of that type (physical or mental) **steps down one category** and **you recover all health or resolve**:

> Major → Severe → Minor → Healed

### Example of Recovery

- Major Harm (*Broken Leg*) → Severe Harm (*Splinted Leg*)
- Severe Harm (*Splinted Leg*) → Minor Harm (*Limp*)
- Minor Harm (*Limp*) → Healed

### Setbacks

If you take new harm before your healing clock is full, **erase all progress**.
Healing is fragile—fresh wounds undo your recovery.

### Self-Healing

You can attempt to heal yourself, but it’s difficult. The GM may apply **penalties** to reflect pain, limited tools, or poor conditions.

### Recovery in the Fiction

Recovery isn’t just a roll—it’s a story. Show how your character rests, heals, or leans on others.
Moments of recovery can reveal vulnerability, deepen bonds, or show growth after hardship.

## Summary

- Harm reduces **Health** (physical) or **Resolve** (mental).
- 2 damage = Minor harm, 4 = Severe, 6+ = Major.
- Minor: –1 to a skill | Severe: –2 to a skill | Major: –3 to an attribute.
- Penalties don’t stack; take only the worst one.
- At 0 Health or Resolve, you’re **Broken**.
- Recovery reduces harm step-by-step through rest and care.
