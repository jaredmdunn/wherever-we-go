# Money
In *Wherever We Go*, money isn’t tracked with exact coins and ledgers. Instead, it is abstracted into two parts: **coin** (ready cash on hand) and **wealth** (long-term savings and assets). This keeps money simple but still meaningful to play.

---

## Coin
**Coin** is an abstract measure of cash and liquid assets.

### Monetary Values
- **1 coin:** A full purse of silver pieces. About a week’s wages.
- **2 coin:** A fine weapon, a week’s income for a small business, or luxury clothing.
- **4 coin:** A satchel of silver. About a month’s wages.
- **6 coin:** An exquisite jewel or a heavy burden of silver pieces.
- **8 coin:** A safe of valuables or a rare luxury commodity.
- **10 coin:** A significant asset liquidated (e.g., a horse, a carriage, or the deed to a small property).

More than 4 coin is an impractical amount of money to keep lying around. You must spend the excess or convert it into **wealth**.

### Spending Coin
Coin is not spent explicitly to buy things. Instead, it can help you in certain situations. The GM has final say whether spending coin will help you in a given situation. Examples:

- Spend 1 coin to increase the effect of an action.
- Spend 1 coin to give yourself advantage on an action.
- Spend coin to avoid a consequence.
- Spend coin to boost a **wealth roll** (discussed below).

## Wealth  
Wealth represents your long-term savings, investments, and financial reserves. It’s not money in your pocket—it’s money you’ve set aside and secured.  

| Wealth Score | Dice | Description                                |
|--------------|-------|--------------------------------------------|
| 0            | 1D6   | Destitute. You live day-to-day, scraping by. |
| 1-10         | 2D6   | Poor. You live with little cushion and few comforts. |
| 11-20        | 2D8   | Modest. You enjoy a comfortable life with stability. |
| 21-40        | 2D10  | Fine. You live in luxury with security and ease. |
| 41+          | 2D12  | Wealthy. You hold significant assets, property, or reserves. |

### Wealth Rolls
Paying for goods and services never costs a fixed amount of coin. Unless you are destitute, you can usually scrape something together.

When you make a significant purchase or payment, **roll your wealth dice** and add **+1D6** for each coin you choose to spend on top.

The outcome of the roll determines the **quality** of what you acquire—not whether you acquire it at all. Even a low roll means you succeed, but the result may be poor quality, slow delivery, or unreliable. A high roll yields excellent quality, fast service, or lasting benefit.

### Wealth Roll Results  

A wealth roll works like an action roll, but instead of measuring success or failure, it measures the **quality of what you secure relative to your current wealth score**. A character with higher wealth will naturally get better outcomes overall, even on low-edge results.  

- **0 edges (Below Standard):** You manage something worse than what your wealth would normally provide—low quality, inconvenient, or disappointing for your means.  
- **1 edge (Standard):** You get the expected quality for someone of your wealth—average, reliable, and what others would expect of you.  
- **2 edges (Above Standard):** You secure something a step better than expected—higher quality, faster, or more impressive than the baseline for your wealth.  
- **3+ edges (Exceptional):** You obtain something remarkable for your station—far exceeding expectations, with added benefits, prestige, or reliability.  

| Edges | Result | Guidance |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 0 | Below Standard | Worse than expected for your wealth; shoddy, late, or unimpressive. |
| 1 | Standard | The expected quality for your wealth score; reliable and appropriate. |
| 2+ | Above Standard | Better than expected for your wealth score; faster, finer, or with extra perks. |

## Coin and Wealth Together
Coin and wealth are linked but not interchangeable:

- **Depositing:** You can move coin into wealth at a 1:1 ratio. 
- **Withdrawing:** You can convert wealth into coin, but it costs **2 wealth for every 1 coin** withdrawn. This reflects the cost of liquidating long-term investments.

Thus, coin is the flexible currency for immediate play, while wealth measures your long-term financial stability. Both matter, but in different ways.

Depositing and withdrawing tend to take a significant amount time and cannot be done in the heat of the moment. These actions typically take place during a montage sequence.
