# Traits
Traits are the fixed, defining characteristics that set each character and creature apart in *Wherever We Go*. Rather than relying on broad categories like “race,” “ancestry,” or “species,” this system uses traits to describe the natural features, strengths, and limitations that make your character unique.

Traits can represent anything from physical size to heightened senses, natural armor, or unusual movement. They’re not meant to capture every detail of appearance or backstory—only the features that are significant enough to have a **mechanical impact** during play.

Whether you want to play a nimble halfling, a towering automaton, or a wolfkin with keen senses, traits provide the tools to highlight what makes your character stand out.

## How Traits Work
Each trait provides a distinct **benefit or limitation** that affects how your character interacts with the world. Some traits grant **bonuses or penalties** to rolls, allow special actions, or impose restrictions. To maintain balance, whenever you choose a positive trait during character creation, you must also select a negative trait. This ensures that every character’s unique abilities come with meaningful trade-offs.

Bonuses and penalties granted by traits follow the same rules as any other modifier: they **step dice up or down** (see [Bonuses and Penalties](/03_action-rolls/index.md#bonuses-and-penalties)).

## Categories of Traits
Traits fall into several broad categories. Each is described below, with sample traits and their effects.

### Aptitudes
How easily you learn skills related to a given attribute. See [Advancement](08_advancement.md).

#### Natural (*Attribute*)
Skills for the specified attribute come more easily to you.
- Gain a **+1 bonus** on training rolls for skills associated with that attribute.

#### Unnatural (*Attribute*)
Skills for the specified attribute come less naturally.
- Suffer a **–1 penalty** on training rolls for skills associated with that attribute.

### Size
How large or small you are compared to a regular human.

#### Smaller
You are significantly smaller than the average human—child-sized, halfling-like, or a diminutive construct.
- **Stealth Bonus:** +1 bonus on Stealth rolls where small size helps you hide, squeeze, or avoid notice.
- **Manipulation Bonus:** +1 bonus on Manipulation rolls where being small helps you appear harmless or unimportant.
- **Strength Limit:** Your Strength cannot be rated higher than a **d8**.

#### Larger
You are notably larger than the average human—like ogres, large robots, or genetically enhanced beings.
- **Might/Menace Bonus:** +1 bonus on Might or Menace rolls where size and mass are advantageous.
- **Stealth Penalty:** –1 penalty on Stealth rolls where size makes hiding or moving quietly difficult.
- **Strength Minimum:** Your Strength cannot be rated lower than a **d10**.

> **Note**:
> 
> Alternative versions of these size traits might be **Tiny** and **Huge**, which just have higher bonuses and penalties.

### Natural Weapons and Armor
Whether or not due to your heritage, species, or any other reason, you have natural weapons or armor as part of your body.

#### Natural Weapon (*Weapon*, *Damage*)
You possess a natural weapon (claws, fangs, horns, tail, etc.).
- Your natural weapon has a damage score (1, 2, 3, or 4).
- When you do an unarmed attack with this natural weapon, it does that amount of damage.

#### Natural Armor (*Armor*, *Damage*, *Coverage*)
You are protected by natural armor (thick hide, scales, exoskeleton, etc.).
- Your natural armor has a damage score (1, 2, 3, or 4) and a coverage score (1-15).
- Natural armor works exactly like regular armor, except it cannot be broken by ordinary means.

### Resistances, Vulnerabilities, and Immunities
These traits define how you interact with specific harmful forces—reducing, increasing, or negating their effects. Apply them when resisting an effect or taking damage of that type.

#### Resistant (*Effect*)
You take half damage or gain a **+1 bonus** on rolls to resist the specified effect (fire, cold, poison, etc.).

#### Vulnerable (*Effect*)
You take double damage or suffer a **–1 penalty** on rolls to resist the specified effect.

#### Immune (*Effect*)
You are unaffected by the specified effect.

### Sensory
These traits define how you perceive the world. They may heighten or weaken specific senses, grant special perception, or impose limitations that affect Observation or interaction rolls.

#### Sharp (*Sense*)
One sense (sight, smell, hearing, etc.) is exceptionally keen.  
- Gain a **+1 bonus** on Observation rolls where that sense is especially useful.

#### Dull (*Sense*)
One sense is weaker than average.  
- Suffer a **–1 penalty** on Observation rolls where that sense is important.

#### Darkvision
You can see in darkness as well as daylight.

#### Nocturnal
If paired with **Darkvision**, you have **Dull (Vision)** in bright light.

### Movement
These traits describe how you move through the world, granting new forms of movement or modifying existing ones. They may let you climb, swim, or fly more easily—or make certain types of movement slower or more difficult.

#### Flying
You can fly or levitate. Flight counts as a **minor action** in combat.

#### Climbing
You climb with ease.  
- Climbing is a **minor action** in combat.  
- Gain a **+1 bonus** on Mobility rolls for climbing.

#### Swimming
You move through water as easily as on land.  
- Swimming is a **minor action** in combat.  
- Gain a **+1 bonus** on Mobility rolls for swimming.

#### Slow (*Movement Type*)
You are hindered in one type of movement (e.g., swimming, climbing).  
- That movement requires a **major action** in combat.  
- Suffer a **–1 penalty** on Mobility rolls for that movement type.

### Magic
These traits represent your connection to supernatural or mystical forces. They determine whether you can sense, resist, or wield magic and define the ways in which you interact with magical energy or phenomena.

#### Magic Aware
You can sense magic.  
- When making an Observation or Insight roll, you may detect the presence or lingering effects of magic.

#### Magic User
You can wield magical powers.  
- Choose at least one magic talent (see the Magic chapter).  
- You also gain the benefits of **Magic Aware**.
