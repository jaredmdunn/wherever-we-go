# Willpower, Drives, and Talents

Willpower, Drives, and Talents together define what your character cares about, what they can do, and when they can push themselves beyond normal limits.  

- **Willpower (WP)** is a limited resource representing your character’s grit, determination, and inner strength.
- **Drives** are the deep motivations that guide your character’s choices—and can give you a powerful boost when you spend WP on them.
- **Talents** are the specializations and exceptional abilities your character has mastered, giving them access to unique abilities that make them stand out.

## Willpower  

Willpower (WP) is the currency you spend for your character’s biggest, most meaningful moments. It powers Talents, fuels your Drives, and lets you go further when the stakes are high.

You can have a maximum of **6 WP** at a time. Tracking WP matters—when you spend it, it should feel like your character is digging deep.

### Gaining Willpower  

Willpower is earned through play:

- **As a Roll Benefit:** The GM may grant 1 WP as a benefit of an action roll’s outcome (often on a great success or as a silver lining to failure).
- **From Passive Abilities:** Some Talents grant WP under certain conditions (e.g., when you win a duel, when you successfully heal another character, when you face danger head-on).

There is no automatic refresh between sessions or scenes. If you want more WP, you must earn it through play or triggers.

### Spending Willpower

You spend WP when you want to make your most dramatic choices matter:

- **Activating Talents:** Most **Active Abilities** cost 1–3 WP to use (see below).
- **Supercharging a Roll:** Spend 2 WP to add bonus dice equal to the intensity of a relevant Drive (see below).
- **Defying a Drive:** If you fail a Mind resistance roll against a Drive but still want to act against it, spend 1 WP to do so.

## Drives  

Drives represent your character’s core motivations—their ideals, obsessions, needs, or loyalties. They are written as:

**Verb (Noun) — Reason**  

Examples:
- **Love (Music) —** my parents were music teachers.  
- **Uphold (the Law) —** the people trust me to be a just sheriff.  
- **Need (Alcohol) —** it’s the only way to keep me from thinking about Jane.  
- **Obey (the King) —** he is a just leader and holds the kingdom together.  

### Drive Intensity  

Each Drive has an **intensity** from 1 (mild) to 3 (overwhelming). The higher the intensity, the stronger the pull it has over your character.  

### Acting with or Against a Drive  

When you are about to make a choice that clearly contradicts one of your Drives, the GM may call for a **Mind resistance roll**:  

- If your **edges ≥ Drive intensity**, you may choose how to act.  
- If your **edges < Drive intensity**, you must act in accordance with the Drive—or spend **1 WP** to resist and do otherwise.  

Acting with or against a Drive can also cause the Drive to shift:  
- Acting against it may weaken or even transform it.  
- Leaning into it may deepen its hold on you.  
- The GM and player should negotiate together how Drives evolve—sometimes just a ±1 intensity change, sometimes a complete rewrite.  

### Spending WP to Invoke a Drive  

The most powerful use of a Drive is to spend **2 WP** to invoke it as a dramatic boost:

- Add a number of bonus D6s (in a different color so they stand out) equal to the Drive’s intensity to a roll directly tied to that Drive.
- Narrate how your character’s motivation fuels their effort—this should feel like a defining moment.

#### Example: Invoking a Drive  

Talia has the Drive **Uphold (the Law) – the people trust me to be a just sheriff** with intensity 2.
During play, she faces off against a corrupt magistrate who is about to let a murderer go free. Talia’s player says,
> “This is exactly why she became a sheriff. She won’t let this stand.”  

They spend **2 WP** to invoke the Drive, adding **two bonus D6s** to their Manipulation roll. These extra dice contribute an additional edge to the roll helping Talia make a full success, swaying the jury and forcing the magistrate's hand.

Moments like this show how Drives aren’t just flavor—they let you turn character motivation into mechanical weight, making the story beat more powerful.

## Talents  

Talents are the closest thing *Wherever We Go* has to classes. They represent what makes your character exceptional—their hard-won training, unique skills, or signature tricks.

Talents are organized into **ranks** (typically 1–3, though special cases may go as high as 5). Each rank in a Talent grants one or more **Abilities**:

- **Active Abilities:** Require WP (or sometimes stress/harm) to use. These are your special maneuvers, advanced techniques, or heroic stunts.
- **Passive Abilities:** Always in effect. They may grant situational bonuses, remove penalties, or even generate WP when certain triggers happen.

### Talent Example: Duelist

- **Rank 1:** Passive - *Combat Stance* (gain advantage on Melee rolls when you fight one-on-one).
- **Rank 2:** Active - *Riposte* (spend 1 WP for a free counterattack after being missed in melee).
- **Rank 3:** Active - *Flawless Finish* (spend up to 2 WP to deal an additional 1-2 damage when you hit on a melee attack).

Talents are a way to build identity for your character. A seasoned Duelist feels very different from a Silver-Tongued Negotiator or a Streetwise Survivor—even before WP is spent.
