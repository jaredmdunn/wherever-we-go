# Willpower, Drives, and Talents

Willpower, Drives, and Talents together define what your character cares about, what they can do, and when they can push themselves beyond normal limits.  

- **Willpower (WP)** is a limited resource representing your character’s grit, determination, and inner strength.
- **Drives** are the deep motivations that guide your character’s choices—and can give you a powerful boost when you spend WP on them.
- **Talents** are the specializations and exceptional abilities your character has mastered, giving them access to unique abilities that make them stand out.
