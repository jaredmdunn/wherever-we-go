# Traits
Traits are the fixed, defining characteristics that set each character and creature apart in *Wherever We Go*. Rather than relying on broad categories like “race,” “ancestry,” or “species,” this system uses traits to describe the natural features, strengths, and limitations that make your character unique.

Traits can represent anything from physical size to heightened senses, natural armor, or unusual movement. They’re not meant to capture every detail of appearance or backstory—only the features that are significant enough to have a **mechanical impact** during play.

Whether you want to play a nimble halfling, a towering automaton, or a wolfkin with keen senses, traits provide the tools to highlight what makes your character stand out.

## How Traits Work
Each trait provides a distinct **benefit or limitation** that affects how your character interacts with the world. Some traits grant **bonuses or penalties** to rolls, allow special actions, or impose restrictions. To maintain balance, whenever you choose a positive trait during character creation, you must also select a negative trait. This ensures that every character’s unique abilities come with meaningful trade-offs.

Bonuses and penalties granted by traits follow the same rules as any other modifier: they **step dice up or down** (see [Bonuses and Penalties](/action-rolls#bonuses-and-penalties)).

## Categories of Traits
Traits fall into several broad categories. Each is described below, with sample traits and their effects.

---

### Aptitudes

#### Natural (*Attribute*)
Skills within the specified attribute come more easily to you.  
- Gain a **+1 bonus** on rolls using that attribute.

#### Unnatural (*Attribute*)
Skills within the specified attribute come less naturally.  
- Suffer a **–1 penalty** on rolls using that attribute.

### Size

#### Smaller
You are significantly smaller than the average human—child-sized, halfling-like, or a diminutive construct.
- **Stealth Bonus:** +1 bonus on Stealth rolls where small size helps you hide, squeeze, or avoid notice.  
- **Manipulation Bonus:** +1 bonus on Manipulation rolls where being small helps you appear harmless or unimportant.  
- **Physique Limit:** Your Physique cannot be rated higher than a **d8**.

#### Larger
You are notably larger than the average human—like ogres, large robots, or genetically enhanced beings.
- **Might/Menace Bonus:** +1 bonus on Might or Menace rolls where size and mass are advantageous.  
- **Stealth Penalty:** –1 penalty on Stealth rolls where size makes hiding or moving quietly difficult.

### Natural Weapons and Armor

#### Natural Weapon (*Weapon*)
You possess a built-in weapon (claws, fangs, horns, tail, etc.).

- Add this die when you make an attack using your natural weapon.  
- Natural weapons cannot be degraded.

#### Natural Armor (*Armor*)
You are protected by thick hide, scales, or exoskeleton.  
- Your natural armor has a die rating (**d6**, **d8**, **d10**, or **d12**).
