# Equipment & Inventory

Equipment in *Wherever We Go* isn’t just stuff-it’s options. What you keep ready, what’s buried in a pack, and what’s stored away all shape the choices you can make when it counts.

---

## Inventory Structure

Your inventory is organized by **how quickly you can get to it**. Each section has its own slot capacity.

| Section     | What it means                                                                 | Capacity |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| **At-Hand** | Worn or slung gear you can grab instantly (belt, bandolier, shoulder sling). | **4 normal slots** |
| **Carried** | Packed gear that takes a bit to dig out (bag, satchel, straps).              | **6 normal slots** |
| **Stored**  | Stashed away and **not** on your person (camp, base, hideout).       | **8 normal slots** |

### Access rules

- **Free Play:** At-Hand is immediate; Carried usually takes a little time (GM may call for disadvantage if you’re rushed). Stored requires going to the stash in the fiction.
- **Montages:** You can reorganize-move items between Stored, Carried, and At-Hand (typically one montage action).
- **Missions:** You can surface “we had it ready” via a **flashback** if it fits your loadout and the fiction.
- **Combat:** Drawing from **At-Hand = minor action**. Drawing from **Carried = major action**. Stored is unavailable unless you brought it into the scene earlier (or via flashback).

> **Loadouts vs. Inventory Sections**
>
> Inventory sections describe **where** gear is and **how fast** you can grab it.  
> **Loadout** (chosen at mission start) sets the **total number of item slots** you’re bringing into that mission from At-Hand + Carried. If your chosen loadout holds fewer slots than you have filled across those sections, you must leave some items **Stored**.

## Equipment Characteristics

In addition to its description, with details about how the equipment works, looks, and can be used, equipment will have a few other standard characteristics:

- Rarity - how common the item is.
- Reliability - the "health" of the item, how long it will last before breaking.
- Size - how large the item is, how much space it takes up in inventory.

### Rarity
- **Common / Uncommon / Rare** - influences availability, cost, and who can repair or replace it.

### Reliability
Most gear will have a reliability score (usually 1-4). If the reliability score is reduced to 0, that item is broken and needs repair.
- Note that using damaged gear (gear that has a reliability score below the max) may result in a penalty to the given action.

### Size
Items come in three sizes for slot accounting:

- **Light** - two Light items fit in **one** normal slot.  
- **Normal** - occupies **one** normal slot.  
- **Heavy** - occupies **two** normal slots.

> Example: A rope (Light) and a potion (Light) can share a single slot. A greatsword (Heavy) fills two.

---

## Repair & Maintenance

- Requires appropriate tools/place **and** a montage action.
- Make a **Precision** roll. On success:
  - Restore a number of ticks on the gear equal to the number of edges rolled but no more than the max reliability score.

> **GM Tip:** Don’t use breakage as a gotcha. Let reliability create choices: do you push this tool one more fight, or seek repairs and favors first?

---

## Consumables

Consumables have a **supply rating** showing how much you have left.

- **1** - single use.
- **D6 / D8 / D10 / D12** - a resource die.

**After each use or when the GM calls for it**, roll the consumable’s resource die:
- On **1–2**, step the die **down** (D12 → D10 → D8 → D6).
- If you would step **below D6**, you have **one last use**; after that, it’s **depleted**.

Examples:
- **Arrows (D8)** - fire, then roll; on 1-2, step to **D6**.
- **Rations (D10)** - consume on travel days; 1-2 steps to **D8**.
- **Alchemist’s reagents (1)** - single-use bottle.

> **Refilling:** A montage action with appropriate access can bump a consumable up one step (GM may call for cost/roll for rarer supplies).

## Quick Reference (Access & Actions)

- **Draw At-Hand** item: **minor action** (combat).
- **Draw Carried** item: **major action** (combat).
- **Repack gear** between sections: montage action.
- **Bring Stored gear into play**: scene in fiction, or **flashback** during missions (if it fits your loadout and prep).

## Example Inventory (Partially Filled)

Below are three tables-one per section-with the correct number of **normal slots**.  
- Two **Light** items can share a cell.  
- **Heavy** items span two cells.  
- Empty cells are open capacity.
