# Resistances  
Resistances represent a character’s ability to endure consequences—whether physical, mental, or emotional. They are the measure of how much strain your body and mind can take before suffering lasting harm.  

When faced with danger, a character may sometimes be able to **resist** the effects, reducing or avoiding the worst of the outcome. This doesn’t always cancel the consequence entirely, but it can lessen its severity or turn a lasting effect into a temporary setback.  

Resistances come into play in many situations:  
- Pushing through exhaustion during a long journey.  
- Holding your breath while trapped underwater—or under the effects of a suffocation spell.  
- Resisting the pull of a mind-control enchantment.  
- Refusing to give in to temptation or fear.  

Resistances are not limited to avoiding physical **harm**. They also apply when your will, emotions, or clarity of mind are tested. In this way, they make characters feel resilient and dynamic, able to stand strong against both swords and sorcery, both pain and persuasion.  

## Body and Mind  
In *Wherever We Go*, characters have two resistances: **Body** and **Mind**.  

- **Body** represents your physical resilience and control over your body. It is based on your **Physique + Precision** and comes into play when resisting exhaustion, poison, injury, or any danger that tests your strength, reflexes, or stamina.  
- **Mind** represents your willpower, clarity, and emotional fortitude. It is based on your **Intuition + Wits** and comes into play when resisting fear, stress, manipulation, or anything that threatens your thoughts, emotions, or sense of self.  

Body and Mind are the core defenses of your character. They are used whenever a **resistance roll** is called for, and they will also determine your thresholds for harm, which are explained later.
