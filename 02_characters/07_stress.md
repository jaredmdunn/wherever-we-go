# Stress  

Stress represents your character’s adrenaline, nerves, and mental strain in high-stakes situations. It builds as you push yourself beyond your limits, face fear or magical effects, or otherwise endure intense pressure.  

Unlike harm, stress is temporary. It comes and goes within a session and gives you a way to measure how close your character is to losing their cool.

## Gaining Stress  

You gain **1 stress die** in your pool when you:  

- **Push a roll** — rerolling after a failure or partial success.  
- **Choose to take stress** in place of a worse consequence (if allowed by the GM or a talent).  
- **Fail a Mind resistance roll** against fear, magical influence, or other mental effects.  

Stress dice remain in your pool until cleared.

## When to Roll Stress Dice  

Stress dice are only added to rolls in **high-stakes situations**:  
- Always roll stress dice in **Risky, Desperate, or Dire** positions.  
- Stress dice are **never** rolled in a **Safe** position.  
- In a **Controlled** position, rolling stress dice is optional—use them only if the stakes feel dramatic.  
- During **montages**, stress dice are usually not rolled at all, since these scenes represent slower-paced, safer moments.

## Panic Rolls  

Stress makes you more effective—until it doesn’t. When you roll a **1** on any stress die, make a **Panic Roll**:  

1. Roll a **D6**.  
2. If the result is **higher** than your current number of stress dice, you keep control and press on—narrate a flicker of fear or hesitation but continue.  
3. If the result is **equal to or lower** than your current number of stress dice, you suffer mental harm equal to your number of stress dice (using Mind thresholds).  

If you suffer harm from a Panic Roll, you must take a **Panic Action** appropriate to the severity of harm:

### Panic Actions

| Harm Level | Effect on Action | Example Panic Actions |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Level 1 Harm** | Lose **one edge** on your roll but complete the action if you still have edges left. | • Flinch or duck too late, leaving yourself off-balance.<br>• Drop a tool or weapon and waste time grabbing it.<br>• Shout involuntarily, revealing your position.<br>• Freeze for a heartbeat, letting the danger escalate. |
| **Level 2 Harm** | Lose your original action entirely and must do something tied to your panic instead. | • Go silent and freeze until someone snaps you out of it.<br>• Back up slowly, retreating from the threat.<br>• Cover your head or shield yourself rather than acting.<br>• Call out for help or babble nervously, delaying the group. |
| **Level 3 Harm** | Lose your original action, do something **extreme** tied to your panic, then immediately become **Broken**. No Death Save is required, but you are incapacitated afterward. | • Sprint blindly into danger, heedless of risk.<br>• Lash out violently, harming a friend or breaking something valuable.<br>• Flee in a wild panic until you collapse.<br>• Fall to the ground, sobbing or screaming uncontrollably before going limp. |

Panic Actions escalate with severity — Level 2 should create a clear obstacle or delay, while Level 3 should dramatically shift the scene or create immediate danger. These moments are opportunities to highlight your character’s humanity and raise the stakes for everyone at the table.

## Clearing Stress

Stress doesn’t stick around forever. You can clear it by taking time to rest, focus, or connect with others.

Clearing stress is typically done as part of a **montage action**:
- Describe how your character releases tension—resting, meditating, laughing with friends, working on a craft, sparring, or otherwise centering themselves.
- Roll an appropriate skill (common choices include **Connection** to bond with others, **Insight** for quiet reflection, or even **Tinkering** or **Marksmanship** if practicing your craft is calming).
- Clear a number of stress dice equal to **edges rolled + 1**.

Even when you are not resting or in a montage sequence, 1 stress can be cleared as an added benefit to full or critical success on an action roll.

## Stress in Play

Stress is meant to build tension, not punish players. It makes rolls more dramatic, raises the stakes of action, and creates space for rich roleplay when panic sets in.
