# Harm and Recovery

Danger, risk, and the chance of getting hurt are a natural part of adventure. *Wherever We Go* uses **harm** to represent the lasting consequences of those risks—whether wounds, fear, exhaustion, or emotional strain—and **recovery** to represent the time and effort it takes to get back on your feet. Harm raises the stakes of the story, while recovery creates space for quieter moments of reflection, growth, and care.

## Harm

Harm is how the game tracks lasting consequences from danger. It is not meant to punish characters but to make risks meaningful and to create opportunities for drama and tension. Harm affects what your character can do until it’s treated, but it also tells the story of the hardships they have endured.

### Levels of Harm

Harm is tracked on a single harm track. Each level has two boxes, except Level 3, which has only one.

- **Level 1 — Reduced Effect:** Minor harm that makes actions harder or slower. Examples: *Bruised, Distracted, Winded, Shaken*.
- **Level 2 — Disadvantage:** Serious harm that imposes a direct penalty to rolls. Examples: *Deep Cut, Concussed, Panicked, Enraged*.
- **Level 3 — Broken:** Severe harm that leaves you unable to act until it’s addressed. Examples: *Broken Arm, Impaled, Terrified, Dissociating*.

If you must take harm and there’s no space at the appropriate level, the harm escalates to the next level. If all boxes are full, the harm is even worse—potentially permanent injury, complete mental collapse, or death.  

### Thresholds

When harm is inflicted, compare the incoming damage to the appropriate **resistance threshold** to see what level of harm you suffer.  

- **Physical harm** uses your **Body** rating.  
- **Mental harm** uses your **Mind** rating.  

Each threshold is a target number based on your resistance. If the incoming damage is **greater than or equal to** a threshold, you take harm of that level (unless it meets or exceeds a higher threshold, in which case you take the higher level of harm).  

Your thresholds are calculated as:  

- **Level 1 Harm:** Resistance ÷ 10  
- **Level 2 Harm:** Resistance ÷ 6  
- **Level 3 Harm:** Resistance ÷ 2  

#### Example 1: Physical Harm (Body = 18, D10 + D8)
- Threshold 1: 18 ÷ 10 = **1**  
- Threshold 2: 18 ÷ 6 = **3**  
- Threshold 3: 18 ÷ 2 = **9**  

- If you take **1 or 2 points** of physical damage, you suffer **Level 1 harm** (*Bruised*).  
- If you take **3–8 points** of physical damage, you suffer **Level 2 harm** (*Concussed*).  
- If you take **9+ points** of physical damage, you suffer **Level 3 harm** (*Broken Arm*).

#### Example 2: Mental Harm (Mind = 14, D8 + D6)
- Threshold 1: 14 ÷ 10 = **1**  
- Threshold 2: 14 ÷ 6 = **2**  
- Threshold 3: 14 ÷ 2 = **7**  

- If you take **1 point** of mental damage, you suffer **Level 1 harm** (*Distracted*).
- If you take **2–6 points** of mental damage, you suffer **Level 2 harm** (*Panicked*).
- If you take **7+ points** of mental damage, you suffer **Level 3 harm** (*Catatonic*).

These thresholds make different characters feel distinct. A tough fighter with a high Body score can shake off blows that would incapacitate a fragile scholar. A seasoned leader with a steady Mind might resist fear or manipulation longer than others but may still fall just as hard if they’re pushed past their breaking point.

> **GM Tip:**  
> If the damage is **below the Level 1 threshold**, no mechanical harm is recorded. Describe the outcome in the fiction—scratches, close calls, frights—but let the character keep moving without penalty. Only the toughest or most iron-willed characters will have thresholds high enough to completely shrug off low-level damage like this, so when it happens, it should feel like a moment of competence or grit worth highlighting.

### Harm Table

Use the harm table to record lasting injuries, conditions, or emotional states. You don’t need to track which threshold was used—only the fictional result (for example, *Bruised*, *Distracted*, *Concussed*).

### Becoming Broken  

When you suffer Level 3 harm, you become **Broken**. This is the most dangerous state your character can be in—when harm is severe enough to leave you unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to act.  

- **Incapacitated:** While Broken, you are unconscious or otherwise unable to meaningfully act until stabilized.  
- **Death Save:** When you become Broken, immediately roll a **D20**.  
  - On a **1**, you face death or an equally catastrophic fate (GM discretion).  
  - If you roll **less than or equal to the damage you just took**, you will suffer a **permanent injury**.
  - If you roll **greater than the damage you just took**, you are still incapacitated but stable. 

However, the consequences of a failed roll do not happen immediately. Instead, roll a **D6**. This sets up a clock of that size. Ticks in the clock are filled any time an action roll is made by anyone (character or NPC, ally or enemy). Once the clock fills up, the consequences of the Death Save become permanent. This gives allies a chance to intervene.

#### Stabilizing the Broken
A first aid attempt can be made to help a Broken character (usually using **Medicine** for physical harm or **Connection** for mental harm).  
- Only **one first aid attempt** may be made (though it can be rolled with help).  
- Add the number of **edges** rolled on this first aid check to the result of the Death Save.  
  - If the original roll was a **1**, any number of edges will save the character’s life.  
  - If the adjusted result still falls below the damage taken, the character still suffers a permanent injury.  

#### Permanent Injury  

A **permanent injury** represents lasting damage—physical or mental—that will never fully heal. Mechanically, a permanent injury means you **step down one of your attribute dice** (Physique, Precision, Intuition, or Wits-whichever makes sense in the fiction). This will also change your resistance thresholds.

Permanent injuries should also have narrative consequences. Examples:  
- **Physical:** A limp, a missing finger, an old wound that never quite healed.  
- **Mental:** Persistent nightmares, paranoia, memory loss, or a new phobia.  

If stepping down an attribute would take it from a **D6 to 0**, the character dies (or suffers an equally irreversible consequence agreed upon by the table).  

Becoming Broken should always feel like a dramatic turning point—an opportunity for the table to decide together what this moment means for the story, whether it ends a character’s journey or marks them forever.

## Recovery  

Healing harm takes time, care, and often the help of others. Recovery is tracked on a **4-segment healing clock**, representing your progress back to health.  

### How Healing Works

Recovery is typically attempted as part of a **montage**, when the group has time to rest, regroup, and pursue their own goals. A character may usually attempt recovery no more than **twice per montage**.

Someone must tend to your wounds or mental state. Most often, this involves the **Medicine** skill for physical injuries, but **Connection** might apply for emotional or mental recovery.

Whoever is providing treatment rolls, and you mark a number of segments equal to the **edges** rolled:

- **0 edges:** No progress.
- **1 edge:** Mark 1 segment.
- **2 edges:** Mark 2 segments.
- **3+ edges:** Mark 3 segments.

When the clock fills, reduce every harm on your sheet by one level and clear the clock. Any leftover progress carries over to a fresh clock.

### Examples of Recovery

- A Level 3 harm (*Broken Arm*) is reduced to Level 2 (*Splinted Arm*).
- A Level 2 harm (*Concussed*) is reduced to Level 1 (*Headache*).
- A Level 1 harm (*Bruised*) is completely cleared.

### First Aid  

Immediate first aid cannot reduce harm levels but can stabilize a character to prevent death, permanent injury, or total breakdown. Examples:  

- Binding wounds to stop bleeding.  
- Splinting a limb so it can be moved safely.  
- Talking down a panicked ally so they can act again.  

This buys time until proper recovery can be attempted during a montage.  

### Self-Healing  

Characters can attempt to heal themselves, though it may be less effective or carry risk. The GM may apply disadvantage or reduced effect, and the consequences for failure can be severe (e.g., infection, lingering trauma, worsening injuries).

### Setbacks  

Whenever you suffer new harm, erase any progress on your healing clock. Recovery is fragile—fresh injuries can undo days or weeks of healing.  

### Recovery in the Fiction  

Recovery isn’t just mechanical. Use these scenes to show what your character does to heal—quiet nights with a healer, whispered prayers, moments of bonding, or solitary reflection. These moments can reveal character growth, deepen relationships, or introduce new story hooks.

I want every time someone takes damage for it to matter:

| Level | # of injuries | effect | skill / attribute |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | -1 | - |
| 2 | 2 | -2 | - |
| 3 | 1 | -3 | - |
| 4 | 1 | broken | - |

IDEA: 3 level 1 injuries: -1 on 3 different skills, 2 level 2 injuries: -2 on 2 different skills, 1 level 3 injury: -3 on an attribute --> worst penalty applies (only the worst injury penalty applies)

IDEA: level 3 injuries are potentially lethal

IDEA: Potential injury table:

| Level | Effect | Injury |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | -1 to Skill | - |
| 1 | -1 to Skill | - |
| 1 | -1 to Skill | - |
| 2 | -2 to Skill | - |
| 2 | -2 to Skill | - |
| 3 | -3 to Attribute | - |
| 4 | Broken | - |

IDEA: arrange as pyramid or reverse pyramid?

IDEA: Thresholds stay the same
