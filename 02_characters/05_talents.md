## Talents

Talents are the closest thing *Wherever We Go* has to classes. They represent what makes your character exceptional—their hard-won training, unique skills, or signature tricks.

Talents are organized into **ranks** (typically 1–3, though special cases may go as high as 5). Each rank in a Talent grants one or more **Abilities**:

- **Active Abilities:** Require WP (or sometimes stress/harm) to use. These are your special maneuvers, advanced techniques, or heroic stunts.
- **Passive Abilities:** Always in effect. They may grant situational bonuses, remove penalties, or even generate WP when certain triggers happen.

### Talent Example: Duelist

- **Rank 1:** Passive - *Combat Stance* (gain advantage on Melee rolls when you fight one-on-one).
- **Rank 2:** Active - *Riposte* (spend 1 WP for a free counterattack after being missed in melee).
- **Rank 3:** Active - *Flawless Finish* (spend up to 2 WP to deal an additional 1-2 damage when you hit on a melee attack).

Talents are a way to build identity for your character. A seasoned Duelist feels very different from a Silver-Tongued Negotiator or a Streetwise Survivor—even before WP is spent.


### TALENT IDEA

Talents are also ranked D6 to D12, representing the size of the talent die when you use that talent. For example: Spear Fighter (D8) - you add a D8 on melee attacks when fighting with a spear

A Talent could look like this

Talent Name (CURRENT DIE VALUE)
- [ ] Ability Name - Ability description
- [ ] Ability Name - Ability description
- [ ] Ability Name - Ability description
- [ ] etc.

Each time you advance a talent, you get to pick a new ability. Some abilities may require a certain Die value ranking.
