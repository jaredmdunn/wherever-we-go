# Talents

Talents represent what makes you exceptional-your refined training, natural aptitude, or unique approach to action. They’re the signature techniques, instincts, and specialties that set you apart from ordinary people.

Each Talent has a **die rating** (from **D6** to **D12**) representing how proficient you are with that talent.

---

## How Talents Work

A Talent is made up of a list of **Abilities** that define what you can do with it. Some abilities are always active, while others require you to spend **Willpower (WP)** or accept strain, stress, or other costs.

When you gain or advance a Talent:
- Increase its **die rating** (D6 → D8 → D10 → D12).
- Choose a new **Ability** from that Talent’s list.
- Some abilities may require a specific minimum die rating to unlock.

### Talent Format

Each Talent is written like this:

**Talent Name (Current Die Value)**

*Talent Description*

- [ ] **Ability Name** - Description of what the ability does.
- [ ] **Ability Name** - Description of what the ability does.
- [ ] **Ability Name** - Description of what the ability does.
- [ ] etc.

You can mark which abilities you’ve unlocked with a check mark.
