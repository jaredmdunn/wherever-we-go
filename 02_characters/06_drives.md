# Drives

Drives represent your character’s core motivations-their ideals, obsessions, needs, or loyalties. They are written as:

**Verb (Noun) - Reason**

Examples:
- **Love (Music)** - my parents were music teachers.
- **Uphold (the Law)** - the people trust me to be a just sheriff.
- **Need (Alcohol)** - it’s the only way to keep me from thinking about Jane.
- **Obey (the King)** - he is a just leader and holds the kingdom together.

## Drive Intensity

Each Drive has an **intensity** from 1 (mild) to 3 (overwhelming). The higher the intensity, the stronger the pull it has over your character.

## Acting with or Against a Drive

When you are about to make a choice that clearly contradicts one of your Drives, the GM may call for an **Insight action roll**:

- If your **edges ≥ Drive intensity**, you may choose how to act.
- If your **edges < Drive intensity**, you must act in accordance with the Drive-or spend **1 WP** to resist and do otherwise.

Acting with or against a Drive can also cause the Drive to shift:
- Acting against it may weaken or even transform it.
- Leaning into it may deepen its hold on you.
- The GM and player should negotiate together how Drives evolve-sometimes just a ±1 intensity change, sometimes a complete rewrite.

## Spending WP to Invoke a Drive

The most powerful use of a Drive is to spend **1 WP** to invoke it as a dramatic boost:

- Add a bonus equal to the Drive’s intensity to a roll directly tied to that Drive.
- Narrate how your character’s motivation fuels their effort-this should feel like a defining moment.
