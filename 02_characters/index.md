# Characters

## Attributes
Attributes define the basic physical and mental capabilities of the characters. Attributes are used when you roll dice to perform actions in the game and they are also used to determine how much physical and mental hardship a character can endure.

## Skills
Skills represent the knowledge, training, and experience your character has gained over time. While attributes reflect your natural potential, skills reflect what you've learned to do with that potential. Together, skills and attributes determine how effective your character is when taking actions in the world.

## Resistances
Resistances measure how well a character weathers consequences in the moment—physically and mentally. In *Wherever We Go*, there are two resistances: **Body** and **Mind**. They’re used when a **resistance roll** is called for and to determine how much physical and mental **harm** a character can withstand before suffering lasting effects.

## Stress and Willpower
Stress helps you succeed but too much stress can make you crumble.

Willpower powers your talents.

Sometimes, you can use willpower to draw on your stress (spend 1 WP in a risky position to add stress dice).

?? Each edge rolled on stress dice adds 1 WP.

## Traits
Traits are the fixed, defining characteristics that set each character and creature apart in *Wherever You Go*. Rather than relying on traditional categories like "race," "ancestry," or "species," this system uses traits to describe the natural features, strengths, and limitations that make your character unique. Traits can represent anything from physical size to heightened senses, natural armor, or unusual modes of movement.

## Talents
Talents are the unique abilities that set your character apart from others in the world of *Wherever You Go*. While skills reflect learned expertise and traits describe inherent qualities, talents represent specialized powers, magical abilities, or extraordinary techniques that go beyond what most people can achieve. Talents allow you to customize your character, making them distinct and memorable within the group.

## Drives
Drives define your character's deep-seated emotions, beliefs, and desires. They serve as both roleplaying cues and are a mechanical way to make decisions based on what is driving your character.
