# Characters

## Attributes
Attributes define the basic physical and mental capabilities of the characters. Attributes are used when you roll dice to perform actions in the game and they are also used to determine how much physical and mental hardship a character can endure.

## Skills
Skills represent the knowledge, training, and experience your character has gained over time. While attributes reflect your natural potential, skills reflect what you've learned to do with that potential. Together, skills and attributes determine how effective your character is when taking actions in the world.

## Stress and Willpower
Stress helps you succeed but too much stress can make you crumble.

Willpower powers your talents and your boldest moves.

Sometimes, you can spend willpower to **push** before a roll, adding stress dice equal to your current stress, or to power abilities and spells. After a roll, you can **gamble**, increasing your stress to reroll in search of a better outcome.

Each edge rolled on stress dice both adds to your total edges and earns you 1 WP.

## Traits
Traits are the fixed, defining characteristics that set each character and creature apart in *Wherever You Go*. Rather than relying on traditional categories like "race," "ancestry," or "species," this system uses traits to describe the natural features, strengths, and limitations that make your character unique. Traits can represent anything from physical size to heightened senses, natural armor, or unusual modes of movement.

## Talents
Talents are the unique abilities that set your character apart from others in the world of *Wherever You Go*. While skills reflect learned expertise and traits describe inherent qualities, talents represent specialized powers, magical abilities, or extraordinary techniques that go beyond what most people can achieve. Talents allow you to customize your character, making them distinct and memorable within the group.

## Drives
Drives define your character's deep-seated emotions, beliefs, and desires. They serve as both roleplaying cues and are a mechanical way to make decisions based on what is driving your character.
