# Characters

## Attributes
Attributes define the basic physical and mental capabilities of the characters. Attributes are used when you roll dice to perform actions in the game and they are also used to determine how much physical and mental hardship a character can endure.

All characters have 4 attributes:
1. **Physique** - Raw strength and athletic ability.
2. **Precision** - Coordination, accuracy, and fine motor control.
3. **Intuition** - Social and emotional intelligence.
4. **Wits** - Knowledge, perception, and problem-solving.

## Skills
Skills represent the knowledge, training, and experience your character has gained over time. While attributes reflect your natural potential, skills reflect what you've learned to do with that potential. Together, skills and attributes determine how effective your character is when taking actions in the world.

## Traits
Traits are the fixed, defining characteristics that set each character and creature apart in *Wherever You Go*. Rather than relying on traditional categories like "race," "ancestry," or "species," this system uses traits to describe the natural features, strengths, and limitations that make your character unique. Traits can represent anything from physical size to heightened senses, natural armor, or unusual modes of movement.

## Resistances
Resistances measure how well a character weathers consequences in the moment—physically and mentally. In *Wherever We Go*, there are two resistances: **Body** and **Mind**. They’re used when a **resistance roll** is called for and to determine how much physical and mental **harm** a character can withstand before suffering lasting effects.

- **Body (Physique + Precision):** Your physical resilience and control—pushing through exhaustion, shaking off poison, holding your breath, or steadying yourself under fire.
- **Mind (Intuition + Wits):** Your willpower, clarity, and emotional steadiness—resisting fear or manipulation, breaking enchantments, or keeping your cool under pressure.

## Talents
Talents are the unique abilities that set your character apart from others in the world of *Wherever You Go*. While skills reflect learned expertise and traits describe inherent qualities, talents represent specialized powers, magical abilities, or extraordinary techniques that go beyond what most people can achieve. Talents allow you to customize your character, making them distinct and memorable within the group.

## Drives
Drives define your character's deep-seated emotions, beliefs, and desires. They serve as both roleplaying cues and are a mechanical way to make decisions based on what is driving your character.

## Stress and Willpower
