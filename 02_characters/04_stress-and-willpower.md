# Stress and Willpower

## Stress

Stress represents your character’s adrenaline, nerves, and mental strain in high-stakes situations. It builds as you push yourself beyond your limits, face fear or magical effects, or otherwise endure intense pressure.

Stress is temporary. It comes and goes within a session and gives you a way to measure how close your character is to losing their cool.

### Gaining Stress

You gain **1 stress** when you:

- **Push a roll** — rerolling after a failure or partial success.
- **Choose to take stress** in place of a worse consequence (if allowed by the GM) or when using an ability.
- **Fail a Mind resistance roll** against fear, magical influence, or other mental effects.

You must add stress dice to an action roll if it is Desperate or Dire or any time you push.

### Clearing Stress

Stress doesn’t stick around forever. You can clear it by taking time to rest, focus, or connect with others.

Clearing stress is typically done as part of a **montage action**:
- Describe how your character releases tension—resting, meditating, laughing with friends, working on a craft, sparring, or otherwise centering themselves.
- Roll an appropriate skill (common choices include **Connection** to bond with others, **Insight** for quiet reflection, or even **Tinkering** or **Marksmanship** if practicing your craft is calming).
- Clear a number of stress dice equal to **edges rolled + 1**.

Even when you are not resting or in a montage sequence, 1 stress can be cleared as an added benefit to full or critical success on an action roll.

### Stress in Play

Stress is meant to build tension, not punish players. It makes rolls more dramatic, raises the stakes of action, and creates space for rich roleplay when panic sets in.

## Willpower

Willpower (WP) is the currency you spend for your character’s biggest, most meaningful moments. It powers Talents, fuels your Drives, and lets you go further when the stakes are high.

You can have a maximum of **6 WP** at a time. Tracking WP matters—when you spend it, it should feel like your character is digging deep.

### Gaining Willpower  

Willpower is earned through play:

- **As a Roll Benefit:** The GM may grant 1 WP as a benefit of an action roll’s outcome (often on a great success or as a silver lining to failure).
- **From Passive Abilities:** Some Talents grant WP under certain conditions (e.g., when you win a duel, when you successfully heal another character, when you face danger head-on).

There is no automatic refresh between sessions or scenes. If you want more WP, you must earn it through play or triggers.

### Spending Willpower

You spend WP when you want to make your most dramatic choices matter:

- **Activating Talents:** Most **Active Abilities** cost 1–3 WP to use (see below).
- **Supercharging a Roll:** Spend 2 WP to add bonus dice equal to the intensity of a relevant Drive (see below).
- **Defying a Drive:** If you fail a Mind resistance roll against a Drive but still want to act against it, spend 1 WP to do so.
