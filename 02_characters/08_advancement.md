# Advancement

## Advancing Skills
All skills have an advancement clock. When the clock fills up, the clock clears, and your skill improves.

The size of clock is determined by the next skill level, so:

| Current Skill | Next Skill | Clock Size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | D6 | 6 |
| D6 | D8 | 8 |
| D8 | D10 | 10 |
| D10 | D12 | 12 |

These advancement clocks can be filled up in two ways:
1. Experience - using skills will naturally help you improve them.
2. Training - you can also consciously work to improve skills.

### Experience
Characters learn from their experience, success or failure, when the stakes are high enough.

Every time you make a **desperate** or **dire** roll with a skill, mark xp on that skill's advancement clock.

### Training
Characters can intentionally focus on improving skills by training them. This typically occurs in a montage phase. Imagine a training montage like in *Rocky*.

When you choose to train, roll 2 dice of the same type as your appropriate attribute die (e.g., if your Physique die is a D8 and you are training Might, roll 2D8). Mark a number of slots on the advancement clock according to the number of edges rolled.

#### Teachers
Teachers can help you with training, although in many worlds they are expensive and hard to find. A teacher must have a higher skill rating than you do. When they help you train, you have advantage on your training roll. Instead of a D8, the advantage die is the teacher's skill die.

## Advancing Talents
Similar to skills, talents also have advancement clocks. Each talent is unique and may have different sized advancement clocks for each rank of the talent. A standard pattern is:

- Rank 1: 6-sided clock
- Rank 2: 8-sided clock
- Rank 3: 10-sided clock
- Rank 4: 12-sided clock

Talent clocks can be filled in two ways:
1. Training - you can consciously work to develop new talents.
2.
