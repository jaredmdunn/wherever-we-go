# Stress and Willpower

## Stress

Stress represents your character’s adrenaline, nerves, and mental strain in high-stakes situations. It builds as you push yourself beyond your limits, face fear or magical effects, or otherwise endure intense pressure.

Stress is temporary. It comes and goes within a session and gives you a way to measure how close your character is to losing their cool.

### Gaining Stress

You gain **1 stress** when you:

- **Push a roll** — rerolling after a failure or partial success.
- **Choose to take stress** in place of a worse consequence (if allowed by the GM) or when using an ability.

You must add stress dice to an action roll if it is **Desperate** or **Dire** or any time you push. See [Position](/03_action-rolls/index.md#position).

### Clearing Stress

Stress doesn’t stick around forever. You can clear it by taking time to rest, focus, or connect with others.

Clearing stress is typically done as part of a **montage action**:
- Describe how your character releases tension—resting, meditating, laughing with friends, working on a craft, sparring, or otherwise centering themselves.
- Roll an appropriate skill (common choices include **Connection** to bond with others and **Insight** for quiet reflection).
- Clear a number of stress dice equal to **edges rolled + 1**.

Even when you are not resting or in a montage sequence, 1 stress can be cleared as an added benefit to full or critical success on an action roll.

### Stress in Play

Stress is meant to build tension, not punish players. It makes rolls more dramatic, raises the stakes of action, and creates space for rich roleplay when panic sets in.

## Willpower

Willpower (WP) is the currency you spend for your character’s biggest, most meaningful moments. It powers abilities, fuels your drives, and lets you go further when the stakes are high.

You can have a maximum of **6 WP** at a time. Tracking WP matters—when you spend it, it should feel like your character is digging deep.

### Gaining Willpower

Willpower is earned through play:

- **Edges on Stress Dice:** For every edge (6) you roll on any stress dice, you gain 1 WP (up to a max of 6).
- **From Abilities and Spells:** Some abilities and spells may allow you to gain WP under certain conditions.

There is no automatic refresh between sessions or scenes. If you want more WP, you must earn it through play or triggers.

### Spending Willpower

You spend WP when you want to make your most dramatic choices matter:

- **Activating Abilities:** Some abilities will cost WP in order for you to use them. See [Talents](/02_characters/05_talents.md)
- **Casting Spells:** You must spend WP to cast spells. See [Magic](/magic/index.md).
- **Invoking and Defying Drives:** Spend 1 WP to add a bonuses equal to the intensity of a relevant Drive. If you are resisting the pull of drive and acting against it, spend 1 WP. See [Drives](/02_characters/06_drives.md).
- **Digging Deep:** On Desperate and Dire rolls, you must add stress dice, but you can dig deep to add that extra power to Risky rolls as well by spending 1 WP.
