# Equipment & Inventory

Equipment in *Wherever We Go* isn’t just stuff—it’s options. What you keep ready, what’s buried in a pack, and what’s stored away all shape the choices you can make when it counts.

---

## Inventory Structure

Your inventory is organized by **how quickly you can get to it**. Each section has its own slot capacity.

| Section     | What it means                                                                 | Capacity |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| **At-Hand** | Worn or slung gear you can grab instantly (belt, bandolier, shoulder sling). | **4 normal slots** |
| **Carried** | Packed gear that takes a bit to dig out (bag, satchel, straps).              | **6 normal slots** |
| **Stored**  | Stashed away and **not** on your person (camp, base, hideout).       | **8 normal slots** |

### Access rules

- **Free Play:** At-Hand is immediate; Carried usually takes a little time (GM may call for disadvantage if you’re rushed). Stored requires going to the stash in the fiction.
- **Montages:** You can reorganize—move items between Stored, Carried, and At-Hand (typically one montage action).
- **Missions:** You can surface “we had it ready” via a **flashback** if it fits your loadout and the fiction.
- **Combat:** Drawing from **At-Hand = minor action**. Drawing from **Carried = major action**. Stored is unavailable unless you brought it into the scene earlier (or via flashback).

> **Loadouts vs. Inventory Sections**
>
> Inventory sections describe **where** gear is and **how fast** you can grab it.  
> **Loadout** (chosen at mission start) sets the **total number of item slots** you’re bringing into that mission from At-Hand + Carried. If your chosen loadout holds fewer slots than you have filled across those sections, you must leave some items **Stored**.

---

## Item Slots & Weight

Items come in three sizes for slot accounting:

- **Light** — two Light items fit in **one** normal slot.  
- **Normal** — occupies **one** normal slot.  
- **Heavy** — occupies **two** normal slots.

> Example: A rope (Light) and a potion (Light) can share a single slot. A greatsword (Heavy) fills two.

## Equipment Traits

### Rarity
- **Common / Uncommon / Rare** — influences availability, cost, and who can repair or replace it.

### Gear Bonus (Quality)
Some tools and weapons grant a bonus die (**D6–D12**) when you use them. Roll this die with your pool when the item clearly helps.

- The **gear bonus die** is about **performance** (how well it helps you).
- It is **separate from durability** (how long it lasts). See Reliability below.

### Damage (Weapons)
Weapons list a **base damage** (usually 1–4). On a successful attack, deal base damage **+1** per additional edge.

---

## Reliability (Durability) & Effectiveness

Gear can wear down in two different ways:

1. **Reliability Clock (Durability):** How much punishment the item can take before it needs repair.  
2. **Effectiveness Track (Optional):** Some gear loses performance as it degrades, stepping down its **gear bonus die**.

### Reliability Clock (Durability)

- Most items have a **4-segment reliability clock**. (The GM may set **6** for Uncommon, **8** for Rare.)
- Mark **1 segment** when any of these happen:
  - You roll a **1** on the item’s **gear bonus die**.
  - The GM applies a consequence like **“your gear takes a beating.”**
  - You misuse the gear (e.g., parrying a warhammer with a pistol stock).
  - Environmental hardship (sand, saltwater, extreme cold) chews it up in the fiction.

When the reliability clock **fills**, the item becomes **Damaged**:
- It **can’t** provide its gear bonus until repaired, **or**
- If it has a linked **Effectiveness Track**, step the gear bonus die down one size (e.g., D10 → D8), **then clear the reliability clock**.

> **Linked Degradation**
>
> If a piece of gear has a linked effectiveness track, **each time** the reliability clock fills, step the bonus die down one size and **clear** the clock. When stepping below **D6**, the gear **fails** until repaired.

### Repair & Maintenance

- Requires appropriate tools/place **and** a montage action.
- Make a relevant roll (e.g., **Tinkering/Smithing/Crafting**). On success:
  - **Clear** the reliability clock.  
  - If the gear bonus was stepped down, you may restore **one** step per successful repair (GM may require parts or cost for big jumps).

> **GM Tip:** Don’t use breakage as a gotcha. Let reliability create choices: do you push this tool one more fight, or seek repairs and favors first?

## Consumables

Consumables have a **supply rating** showing how much you have left.

- **1** — single use.  
- **D6 / D8 / D10 / D12** — a resource die.

**After each use**, roll the consumable’s resource die:
- On **1–2**, step the die **down** (D12 → D10 → D8 → D6).  
- If you would step **below D6**, you have **one last use**; after that, it’s **depleted**.

Examples:
- **Arrows (D8)** — fire, then roll; on 1–2, step to **D6**.  
- **Rations (D10)** — consume on travel days; 1–2 steps to **D8**.  
- **Alchemist’s reagents (1)** — single-use bottle.

> **Refilling:** A montage action with appropriate access can bump a consumable up one step (GM may call for cost/roll for rarer supplies).

## Quick Reference (Access & Actions)

- **Draw At-Hand** item: **minor action** (combat).  
- **Draw Carried** item: **major action** (combat).  
- **Repack gear** between sections: montage action.  
- **Bring Stored gear into play**: scene in fiction, or **flashback** during missions (if it fits your loadout and prep).

## Example Inventory (Partially Filled)

Below are three tables—one per section—with the correct number of **normal slots**.  
- Two **Light** items can share a cell.  
- **Heavy** items span two cells.  
- Empty cells are open capacity.
