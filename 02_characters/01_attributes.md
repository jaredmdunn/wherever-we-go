Attributes define the basic physical and mental capabilities of the characters. Attributes are used when you roll dice to perform actions in the game and they are also used to determine how much physical and mental hardship a character can endure.

All characters have 4 attributes:
1. **Strength** - Raw power, endurance, and athletic ability.
2. **Dexterity** - Coordination, speed, balance, and fine motor control.
3. **Intuition** - Social and emotional intelligence.
4. **Wits** - Knowledge, perception, and problem-solving.

- **D4** - Fragile
- **D6** - Feeble
- **D8** - Average
- **D10** - Capable
- **D12** - Extraordinary
