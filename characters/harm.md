# Harm  

The worlds explored in *Wherever We Go* are dangerous places. Characters may be battered by steel and sorcery, worn down by hardship, or shaken by fear and despair. All of this is represented through **Harm**.

Harm comes in two forms:  
- **Injuries** – physical damage to the body.
- **Distress** – mental or emotional damage to the mind.

When harm is inflicted, it isn’t always instant death or permanent loss. Instead, it comes in **levels** that track how serious the consequence is.

---

## Levels of Harm

Each character has two harm tracks: one for **injuries** and one for **distress**. Harm is measured in three levels:

- **Level 1 (Reduced Effect):** Minor harm that slows you down or makes you less effective. Examples: *Battered, Bruised, Distracted, Shaken*.
- **Level 2 (Penalty –1):** Moderate harm that imposes a direct penalty on your rolls or actions. Examples: *Deep Cut, Concussed, Panicked, Enraged*.
- **Level 3 (Broken):** Severe harm that incapacitates you until it’s addressed. Examples: *Broken Leg, Impaled, Terrified, Dissociating*.

Each character can take **two Level 1 harms** and **two Level 2 harms**, but only **one Level 3 harm** in each track.

If you need to take a new harm and there is no space left at that level, the harm escalates:
- A new Level 1 harm becomes Level 2 if both Level 1 slots are full.
- A new Level 2 harm becomes Level 3 if both Level 2 slots are full.
- In rare cases, even a Level 1 harm may escalate directly to Level 3 if the Level 1 and Level 2 slots are all full.

This keeps harm meaningful and ensures that injuries and distress build toward lasting consequences.

## Thresholds  

The severity of harm you can endure before reaching each level is measured by adding the two dice sizes of the appropriate resistance (**Body** for injuries and **Mind** for distress) and then dividing and rounding down. For each level of harm, there is threshold that damage needs to pass in order for you to take that level of harm:

- **Threshold 1 (Level 1 Harm):** Resistance / 10
- **Threshold 2 (Level 2 Harm):** Resistance / 6
- **Threshold 3 (Level 3 Harm):** Resistance / 2

## Harm Tables  

Each character tracks their harm on two tables: one for **injuries** (Body) and one for **distress** (Mind). These tables show your thresholds and the consequences of crossing them.

## Healing and Recovery  

Harm can be treated or healed, but it takes time, resources, or help from others. Minor harm may fade quickly, while severe injuries or distress may leave lasting scars—physical, emotional, or both. The details of recovery are covered in the **Healing** section.
