# Traits
Traits are the fixed, defining characteristics that set each character and creature apart in *Wherever We Go*. Rather than relying on broad categories like “race,” “ancestry,” or “species,” this system uses traits to describe the natural features, strengths, and limitations that make your character unique.

Traits can represent anything from physical size to heightened senses, natural armor, or unusual movement. They’re not meant to capture every detail of appearance or backstory—only the features that are significant enough to have a mechanical impact during play.

Whether you want to play a nimble halfling, a towering automaton, or a wolfkin with keen senses, traits provide the tools to highlight what makes your character stand out.

## How Traits Work
Each trait confers a specific advantage, limitation, or ability. Some traits may grant bonuses to rolls, allow special actions, or create vulnerabilities. To maintain balance, whenever you choose a positive trait during character creation, you must also select a negative trait. This ensures that every character’s unique abilities come with meaningful trade-offs.

## Categories of Traits
Traits fall into several broad categories. Each is described below, with sample traits and their mechanical effects.

---

### Aptitudes

#### Natural (*Attribute*)
Skills within the specified attribute come more naturally to you. When you make Practice rolls to improve a skill in that attribute, roll two dice instead of one and keep the higher result.

#### Unnatural (*Attribute*)
Skills within the specified attribute do not come naturally. When you make Practice rolls to improve a skill in that attribute, roll two dice instead of one and keep the lower result.

---

### Size

#### Smaller
You are significantly smaller than the average human—child-sized, halfling-like, or a diminutive construct.
- **Stealth Bonus:** Advantage on Stealth rolls where small size helps you hide, squeeze, or avoid notice.
- **Manipulation Bonus:** Advantage on Manipulation rolls where small size helps you appear harmless or unimportant.
- **Physique Limit:** Your Physique cannot be rated higher than a d8.

#### Larger
You are notably larger than the average human—like ogres, large robots, or genetically enhanced beings.
- **Might/Menace Bonus:** Advantage on Might or Menace rolls where size and mass are advantageous.
- **Stealth Penalty:** Disadvantage on Stealth rolls where size makes hiding or moving quietly difficult.
- **Physique Minimum:** Your Physique cannot be rated lower than a d10.

### Natural Weapons and Armor

#### Natural Weapon (*Weapon*)
You possess a built-in weapon (claws, fangs, horns, tail, etc.). Your natural weapon has a die rating (D6, D8, D10, D12). Add this die when you make an attack with your natural weapon. Your natural weapon can never be degraded.

#### Natural Armor (*Armor*)
You are protected by thick hide, scales, or exoskeleton. Natural armor has a die rating (D6, D8, D10, D12). When you take physical damage, roll your natural armor die along with any worn armor; each edge reduces damage by 1. Natural armor cannot be degraded or broken by ordinary means.

---

### Resistances, Vulnerabilities, and Immunities

#### Resistant (*Effect*)
You take half damage or gain advantage on rolls against the specified effect (fire, cold, poison, etc.).

#### Vulnerable (*Effect*)
You take double damage or suffer disadvantage on rolls against the specified effect.

#### Immune (*Effect*)
You are unaffected by the specified effect.

---

### Sensory

#### Sharp (*Sense*)
One sense (sight, smell, hearing, etc.) is exceptionally keen. Gain advantage on Observation rolls where it applies.

#### Dull (*Sense*)
One sense is weaker than average. Suffer disadvantage on Observation rolls where it applies.

#### Darkvision
You can see in darkness as well as daylight.

#### Nocturnal
If paired with Darkvision, you have Dull (Vision) in bright light.

---

### Movement

#### Flying
You can fly or levitate. Flight counts as a minor action in combat.

#### Climbing
You climb with ease. Climbing is a minor action in combat, and you gain advantage on Mobility rolls for climbing.

#### Swimming
You move through water as easily as on land. Swimming is a minor action in combat, and you gain advantage on Mobility rolls for swimming.

#### Slow (*Movement Type*)
You are hindered in one type of movement (e.g., swimming, climbing). That movement requires a major action in combat, and you have disadvantage on Mobility rolls.

### Magic

#### Magic Aware
You can sense magic. When making an Observation or Insight roll, you may detect its presence or effects.

#### Magic User
You can wield magical powers. Choose at least one magic talent (see the Magic chapter). You also gain the benefits of being Magic Aware.
