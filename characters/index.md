# Characters

## Attributes
Attributes define the basic physical and mental capabilities of the characters. 
Attributes are used when you roll dice to perform actions in the game and they are also
used to determine how much physical and mental hardship a character can endure.

All characters have 4 attributes:
1. Physique - 
2. Precision - 
3. Intuition - 
4. Wits - 

## Skills
Skills represent the knowledge, training, and experience your character has gained over 
time. While attributes reflect your natural potential, skills reflect what you've 
learned to do with that potential. Together, skills and attributes determine how 
effective your character is when taking actions in the world.

## Traits
Traits are the fixed, defining characteristics that set each character and creature apart in *Wherever You Go*. Rather than relying on traditional categories like "race," "ancestry," or "species," this system uses traits to describe the natural features, strengths, and limitations that make your character unique. Traits can represent anything from physical size to heightened senses, natural armor, or unusual modes of movement.

## Talents and Willpower
Talents are the unique abilities that set your PC apart from others in the world of *Wherever You Go*. While skills reflect learned expertise and traits describe inherent qualities, talents represent specialized powers, magical abilities, or extraordinary techniques that go beyond what most people can achieve. Talents allow you to customize your character, making them distinct and memorable within the group.

Talents are often fueled by a resource called Willpower (WP). Willpower is a meta-currency representing your characterâ€™s grit, determination, or energy. Using a talent usually requires spending WP, reflecting the effort or focus needed to perform something truly remarkable.

## Drives
Drives define your character's deep-seated emotions, beliefs, and desires. They serve as both roleplaying cues and are a mechanical way to make decisions based on what is driving your character.
