# Drives

Characters are guided by their **Drives**—deep-seated emotions, beliefs, and desires that shape their decisions and actions. Drives serve as both roleplaying cues and mechanical elements, giving weight to your character’s motivations.

## Defining Drives

A Drive is expressed in the format:

**Verb (Noun) – Reason**

This structure captures the action, the focus, and the motivation behind the Drive.

Examples:
- **Love (Music) –** my parents were music teachers.
- **Uphold (the Law) –** the people trust me to be a just sheriff.
- **Need (Alcohol) –** it is the only way to keep me from thinking about Jane.
- **Obey (the King) –** he is a just leader and holds the kingdom together.

Drives can be positive (e.g., loyalty, compassion) or negative (e.g., hatred, obsession). Each Drive has an **intensity level** of **1 (mild), 2 (strong), or 3 (overwhelming)**.

## Roleplaying with Drives

Drives primarily serve as **guides for roleplaying**, helping you decide how your character reacts when faced with difficult choices.

When a situation arises where a Drive could influence your decision, you may choose to let the Drive guide your action—or try to resist it.

To resist a Drive:
- Make a **Mind saving throw** (or a similar roll defined by the GM).
- If the number of edges is **less than the Drive’s intensity**, your character is compelled to act in line with the Drive.
- If the number of edges is **equal to or greater than the Drive’s intensity**, you may choose freely how to act.

You may also lean into or push against your Drives, changing how strong they are over time:
- If you act **against** a Drive despite failing the roll, its intensity decreases (reflecting doubt or weakening motivation).
- If you act **in line with** a Drive even after succeeding on the roll, its intensity increases (reflecting deeper commitment).

By default, intensities shift by **±1**, though the GM and players may agree on a greater shift if the story demands it.

## Conflicting Drives

Sometimes two Drives push your character in opposite directions. When this happens:

1. Compare the intensities of the two Drives. The higher intensity prevails.
2. If intensities are equal, roll a D20 and call one Drive as high and one as low. That Drive wins.

After resolving the conflict, adjust the intensities as described above, depending on whether you acted with or against the prevailing Drive.

## Bonuses from Drives

Drives can also fuel your character’s abilities. **Once per session**, you may invoke a Drive to gain an advantage on a relevant roll.

When you do, add a Drive die to the relevant roll:

| Intensity | Die |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | D8 |
| 2 | D10 |
| 3 | D12 |
