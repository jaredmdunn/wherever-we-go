# Tools of the Game
The heart of *Wherever We Go* is the fiction—the shared story you and your group bring to life together. Everything begins with what the characters say and do, and how the world responds. But while the story comes first, the tools of the game—dice, clocks, tokens, and sheets—are there to make play richer. They inject tension and discovery into play, while also keeping the game organized and easy to follow as the story grows more complex.

## Character Sheets
Character sheets are the anchor of play. They keep track of who your character is, what they can do, and how they change over time. A sheet records attributes, abilities, resources, conditions, and connections to other characters or factions. It also provides a quick reference for the mechanics most relevant to you, so that the story can flow without getting bogged down in rules lookups.

## Tokens
Tokens, beads, coins, or other small markers can serve as a tactile way to track resources such as willpower or actions. They’re also useful in combat, where they can help visualize positions and movement on the battlefield.

## Dice
In *Wherever You Go*, it is helpful to have several standard sets of polyhedral dice (D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20) in different colors, along with many extra D6s, also in different colors.

### Dice Pool Rolls
The most common roll in the game is a **dice pool roll** where players roll a number of dice of various sizes (D6, D8, D10, and D12) to determine the degree of success of a certain action or save. To determine the outcome of this type of roll, you look for the number of dice that are 6 or higher and the number of dice that are 10 or higher:
- A 6 or higher counts as one **edge**
- A 10 or higher counts as two **edges**

Typically, you need at least one edge for a partial success and two edges for a full success. 0 edges results in failure and more than three edges is a critical success, although sometimes what matters most is not your degree of success but whether or not you did better than the other guy. 

On some rolls, it will also be important to look out for the 1s (**banes**) which can have negative consequences.

### Luck Rolls
**Luck rolls** are typically made with a D20 (although not always) and they are used to insert randomness into play when the characters do not have direct control over something. The result of a luck check is always the value of the die, which may then be compared against another fixed number or a table to determine the effect.

Some examples are:
- Roll a D20 to see how bad a critical injury is.
- Roll a D20 to see how well the plan is going.
- Roll a D4 to see how many guards are posted at the gate.
- Roll a D6. You must get above your current amount of stress not to panic.

## Clocks
A **clock** is typically depicted as a circle divided into some number of segments, usually 4, 6, or 8. But, it can be depicted in any way and can have any number of segments. The segments are filled by actions that the characters take, actions their enemies take, or perhaps merely when time passes. This is very useful for depicting any number of things:
- Obstacles
- Villainous plans
- Healing time
- Journey time
- Long-term project
- etc.
