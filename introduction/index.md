# Introduction
*Wherever We Go* is a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) based on *Blades in the Dark* and the *Year Zero Engine* with heavy inspiration from *Dungeons & Dragons*, *Daggerheart*, *Microscope*, *Kids on Bikes*, and *Mythras* among many others.

*Wherever We Go* aspires to be a game that encourages extended worldbuilding and exploration in any kind of world through roleplaying where characters grow and change based on how they interact with the world, which grows and changes depending on how the character interact with it.

## What is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG)?
Fundamentally, a TTRPG is an improv game that involves telling a story with your friends. For the most part it is a conversation where one of you (the Game Master, aka the GM) describes the world and the characters you meet and you describe what your character does in response. For extra elements of randomness or or to resolve how something goes, dice are often used to determine degrees of success and failure. Occasionally, it may involve getting out a map and some tokens to represent the good guys and bad guys, and playing out a combat.

## Who's Who?
### The Players
Each player creates a character and works with the other players to build the connections that the character have to each other.

The players work together with the Game Master to establish the genre, tone, and style of the game and to build their characters' connections to the world.

### The Characters
The characters are the heart of the story. They can be anyone you imagine—rogues and raiders, wanderers and warriors, villains and visionaries, or ordinary people drawn into extraordinary circumstances.

Each character is more than just a collection of stats or abilities: they are defined by their goals, flaws, and relationships. The choices characters make and the ways they interact with the world shape not only their own journeys but also the story that emerges at the table.

### The Game Master (GM)
The GM establishes the dynamic world around the characters. The GM plays all the non-player characters (NPCs) in the world by giving each one a concrete desire and preferred method of action.

The GM helps organize the conversation of the game so it’s pointed toward the interesting elements of play. The GM isn’t in charge of the story, but they are in charge of presenting interesting opportunities to the players, then follow the chain of action and consequences wherever they lead.
