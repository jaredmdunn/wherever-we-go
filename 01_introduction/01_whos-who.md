# Who's Who

This game is a collaborative story you build together, and everyone at the table has a distinct role to play. Understanding who does what helps keep the conversation flowing smoothly and ensures that every player has a chance to shape the narrative. The roles below define how each person contributes to the shared world, from the heroes driving the story to the GM who brings the world to life.


## The Players

Each player creates a character and works with the other players to build the connections that the character have to each other.

The players work together with the Game Master to establish the genre, tone, and style of the game and to build their characters' connections to the world.

## The Characters

The characters are the heart of the story. They can be anyone you imagine—rogues and raiders, wanderers and warriors, villains and visionaries, or ordinary people drawn into extraordinary circumstances.

Each character is more than just a collection of stats or abilities: they are defined by their goals, flaws, and relationships. The choices characters make and the ways they interact with the world shape not only their own journeys but also the story that emerges at the table.

## The Game Master (GM)

The GM establishes the dynamic world around the characters. The GM plays all the non-player characters (NPCs) in the world by giving each one a concrete desire and preferred method of action.

The GM helps organize the conversation of the game so it’s pointed toward the interesting elements of play. The GM isn’t in charge of the story, but they are in charge of presenting interesting opportunities to the players, then follow the chain of action and consequences wherever they lead.
