# The Flow of the Game
A session of *Wherever We Go* flows between different modes of play, depending on what the players want and where the action leads. There are five distinct modes of play and one session may have all of these, a mix, or just one:

## Worldbuilding

**Worldbuilding** typically takes place in the very first session of play. This is where all players, including the GM collaborate together to create the world that the game will take place in. In the first session, players will create their characters, but they will also get the chance to contribute to the lore, the map, the NPCs, etc. This helps invest everyone in the world that you are discovering together and it doesn't give the burden of the whole world (or the fun of it) to just the GM. Worldbuilding is very useful at the beginning of the game to set the genre, tone, and expectations, but it can also be fun later on to offer a change of pace or to introduce a new character/place/religion/faction/etc.

## Free Play

**Free play** is the default mode of play: characters talk to each other, they go places, they do things, and they make rolls as needed. 

## Mission
In *Wherever We Go*, planning is optional. If the players have an idea for something the characters should do (a **mission**), they can simply jump to the action and leave the planning of it up to the characters off-screen. During the mission, the characters engage with the heist, rescue, sabotage, assault, negotiation, or whatever the mission may be. The players can call for flashbacks to jump back to the planning that happened offscreen and bring in a moment from the past to help them in the present.

## Montage
**Montage** is a useful game mode for covering downtime, journeys, and other longer stretches of time that may occur in the game. The GM gives the players an approximate amount of time (e.g., "You have a few weeks to explore the city", "You spend several months at home", "The journey to the tower will take a couple days", etc.) and then they will set a montage clock. The GM will then focus on each of the players individually as they describe what their character does over that stretch of time. The characters are still free to do things as a group but this is can be a chance to go off to pursue their own goals. As the characters complete attempt actions, the montage clock will fill up. When it does, something happens that draws us back into free play.

## Combat
**Combat** is a game mode that typically happens within a mission or within free play. It adds an extra bit of structure to support the stakes of dangerous situations where characters are fighting enemies, surviving threats, or defending themselves. Combat is still a conversation, but the structure helps pace the action, highlight risks, and ensure that everyone gets a chance to act.
