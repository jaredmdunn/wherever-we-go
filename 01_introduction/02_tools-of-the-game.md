# Tools of the Game

The heart of *Wherever We Go* is the fiction—the shared story you and your group bring to life together. Everything begins with what the characters say and do, and how the world responds. But while the story comes first, the physical tools you bring to the table help keep play organized and engaging.

These tools make it easier for everyone to follow what’s happening, track the state of the world, and stay immersed in the story.

## Character Sheets

Character sheets are the anchor of play. They summarize who your character is and what they are capable of, while also leaving space to record how they change over time. A good sheet helps you stay focused on your character and the story, rather than searching through rules.

## Pencil and Paper

Keep a notebook or some scrap paper handy for taking notes. Players can jot down details about the world, their characters, and memorable moments. The GM can use paper or index cards to keep track of important information to reference during play.

## Dice

You’ll need several standard polyhedral dice (D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20). Having a few sets in different colors is helpful—sometimes you’ll want to roll different dice for different reasons, and color-coding makes it easy to tell them apart at a glance.

## Tokens

Tokens, beads, coins, or other small markers can serve as a tactile way to keep track of resources or to represent characters and locations on a table. They can also be used to make abstract ideas—like time passing or pressure mounting—feel concrete.
