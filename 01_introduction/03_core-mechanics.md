# Core Mechanics
The rules of *Wherever We Go* exist to resolve uncertainty and keep the story moving forward. When the outcome of an action isn’t obvious, the game uses two primary tools: **dice rolls** and **clocks**. These mechanics create tension, reveal surprises, and show how the world changes in response to the characters’ actions.

## Dice Rolls
There are two main kinds of rolls in the game, depending on what you want to learn from the result.

### Impact Rolls
An **Impact Roll** is used when you want to know *how well* something turns out, not just whether it happens. Impact Rolls measure the **degree of success** or failure, and they are the most common type of roll during play.

When you make an Impact Roll, you roll several dice (usually of different sizes) and count **edges**:
- **6 or higher:** counts as 1 edge.
- **10 or higher:** counts as 2 edges.

You then interpret the total number of edges:
- **0 Edges:** Failure. Things go badly or no progress is made.
- **1 Edge:** Mixed Success. The outcome is partially favorable but comes with a cost, complication, or consequence.
- **2 Edges:** Full Success. The outcome is completely favorable, with no major complications.
- **3+ Edges:** Critical Success. The result is exceptional, providing a bonus, extra benefit, or narrative advantage.

Edges make the result more dynamic than a simple pass/fail and help the story twist in unexpected ways.

### Value Rolls
A **Value Roll** is used when what matters is the *number* that comes up on the dice, rather than the degree of success. Value Rolls are often used to discover new details about the world, determine a quantity, or generate a random outcome.

When you make a Value Roll, you roll the required dice and use the result directly—sometimes by comparing it to a target number, sometimes by looking it up on a table, or sometimes by using the exact value as-is.

Common uses include:
- Determining how many of something appear, are lost, or are found.
- Rolling to see which event, item, or NPC shows up from a table.
- Checking whether an event happens by comparing the result to a fixed threshold.
- Measuring the amount of time something takes or how much progress is made.

Value Rolls are a flexible way to introduce unpredictability and discovery into the fiction without focusing on character performance or success/failure.

## Clocks
A **clock** is a visual tracker that shows progress, danger, or change over time. It is usually drawn as a circle divided into segments (4, 6, or 8 are common), but any clear shape works.

Clocks are not always public information. They might:
- Sit on a character sheet to track something personal (like a goal or condition).
- Be kept behind the GM’s screen to secretly track a threat or hidden timer.
- Be displayed in the open to show shared progress or looming danger to everyone at the table.

### Types of Clocks

#### Standard Clocks
A **standard clock** simply fills up over time. When the clock is full, something happens — a project is completed, a threat comes to pass, or an obstacle is overcome.

#### Tug-of-War Clocks
A **tug-of-war clock** can fill and empty as events unfold, representing a back-and-forth struggle. These are perfect for things like social movements gaining or losing steam, a contested area switching control, or a tense negotiation swaying between two outcomes.

#### Racing Clocks
A **racing clock** is used when two or more events are competing toward different outcomes. The first one to fill “wins.” Racing clocks build tension in chases, countdowns, and time-sensitive missions.

### What Clocks Can Represent
Clocks can track almost anything that builds toward a moment of change, such as:
- **Character Progress:** learning a skill, completing a personal project, recovering from harm.
- **Obstacles:** bypassing security, dismantling defenses, solving a mystery.
- **Countdowns:** how much time until reinforcements arrive, a storm hits, a ritual completes, or a villain’s plan comes to fruition.

Clocks don’t *decide* what happens — they reflect the evolving state of the fiction and invite players to respond before time runs out.
