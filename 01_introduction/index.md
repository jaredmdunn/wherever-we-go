# Introduction
*Wherever We Go* is a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) based on *Blades in the Dark* and the *Year Zero Engine* with heavy inspiration from *Dungeons & Dragons*, *Daggerheart*, *Microscope*, *Kids on Bikes*, and *Mythras* among many others.

*Wherever We Go* aspires to be a game that encourages extended worldbuilding and exploration in any kind of world through roleplaying where characters grow and change based on how they interact with the world, which grows and changes depending on how the character interact with it.

> **What is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG)?**
> 
> Fundamentally, a TTRPG is an improv game that involves telling a story with your friends. For the most part it is a conversation where one of you (the Game Master, aka the GM) describes the world and the characters you meet and you describe what your character does in response. For extra elements of randomness or or to resolve how something goes, dice are often used to determine degrees of success and failure. Occasionally, it may involve getting out a map and some tokens to represent the good guys and bad guys, and playing out a combat.
