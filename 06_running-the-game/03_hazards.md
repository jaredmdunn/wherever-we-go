# Hazards

Hazards represent environmental threats—fire, drowning, poison, collapsing structures, and similar dangers—that can injure or impede characters without needing a full creature stat block. They usually trigger when characters enter a risky area, mishandle gear, or suffer the fallout of a failed roll.

Each hazard describes how it is triggered, what defenses apply (often an **Endurance** or **Mobility** roll), and the kind of damage or ongoing effects it inflicts. Use hazards to escalate tension, make bad positions feel dangerous, and remind the table that the world itself can be as lethal as any enemy.

## Drowning and Suffocation

If you are underwater or otherwise can't breath, make an **Endurance** check each round (free action) to hold your breath. On a failure, you start to drown, taking one damage to Health every round until you can get a breath or are Broken.

## Explosions

Explosions are rated by *blast power*. For each creature within range of the blast, roll the explosion’s blast power. On the first edge, the target suffers the base damage of the explosion and for each extra edge, the target suffers an additional point of damage to Health. Targets at arm’s length from the blast suffer one extra point of damage automatically. All targets must make an Endurance roll (not an action) to not be knocked prone. Powerful explosions may also cause falling or fire hazards according the GM's discretion or the item's description.

| Blast Power | Base Damage* | Descriptor | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2D6 | 1 | Small  | Grenade, small charge | 
| 2D8 | 2 | Moderate | Barrel, large charge |
| 2D10 | 3 | Powerful | Car bomb, big spell |
| 2D12 | 4 | Devastating | Massive explosion |

> *The number of zones affected by an explosion is equal to its Base Damage.

## Falling

When you fall onto a hard surface, you automatically suffer damage equal to the distance fallen in feet divided by three (rounded down). For a controlled jump, make a Mobility roll; each edge reduces the damage by one.

## Fire

When exposed to fire, roll for its intensity. For each edge rolled by the fire’s die, you suffer one point of damage to Health. If you take damage, you catch fire and suffer another fire attack at the start of each round, with the intensity increasing by one step each round. A fire goes out automatically after a round in which it causes no damage, or you (or an ally at arm’s length) can put it out with a successful Mobility roll as a full action. Using a blanket or similar item gives a +2 bonus to this roll.

| Intensity | Descriptor | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2D6 | Smoldering  | Candle, ember | 
| 2D8 | Burning | Torch, campfire |
| 2D10 | Blazing | Bonfire, house fire |
| 2D12 | Inferno | Large building, wildfire |

## Hazardous Substances

Hazardous substances include intoxicants, corrosives, venoms, airborne spores, and similar materials that can harm or impair you when swallowed, inhaled, or touched. Each substance is rated by potency. When you are exposed to a hazardous substance, make an opposed **Endurance** roll against the substance’s potency dice. If you win, you suffer its partial effect. If you fail, you suffer its full effect.

| Potency | Base Damage | Descriptor | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2D6 | 1 | Mild  | Weak drink, spoiled food, irritating smoke |
| 2D8 | 2 | Sickening | Strong alcohol, choking fumes, stinging nettles |
| 2D10 | 3 | Debilitating | Numbing venom, potent narcotic, paralytic spores |
| 2D12 | 4 | Overwhelming | Flesh-searing acid, magical blight, lethal gas |

### Examples

#### Lethal Poison
- **Full Effect**: You take base damage to Health each round (every 10 seconds) until you are Broken. If you receive an antidote in time, the effect is halted. If you are Broken, make an Endurance roll against the poison’s potency. If you fail, you die.
- **Partial Effect**: You take base damage to Health.

#### Strong Liquor
- **Full Effect**: For a number of hours equal to the base damage, you suffer a -1 to all skills, unless you are attempting actions against other intoxicated creatures, in which case you get a +1. After those hours have passed, make another Endurance roll against the drug’s potency. If you fail, you immediately take 1 damage to Resolve and fall asleep for a number of hours equal to the value of the drug's potency roll (e.g., roll 2D8 and get an 8 and a 2 -> 10 hours).
- **Partial Effect**: None, but if you continue to drink, your next Endurance roll will have an additional -1 penalty.

#### Paralyzing Gas
- **Full Effect**: You are completely paralyzed and you take base damage to Health. If this results in an injury, it applies to Mobility. As soon as you breathe fresh air, make another Endurance roll against the gas's potency. If you succeed, you become unparalyzed. If you fail, you are paralyzed for a number of rounds equal to the base damage or until you receive an antidote.
- **Partial Effect**: You take base damage to Health. If this results in an injury, it applies to Mobility.
